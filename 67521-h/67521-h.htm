<p>The vast, gray expanse of the desert lay still as a picture
in the heat of the early afternoon. The silence of
waste places held it. It was gaunt and sterile, clad
with a drab growth of sage, flat as a table, and with the
white scurf of the alkali breaking through its parched
skin. It was the earth, lean, sapless, and marked with
disease. A chain of purple hills looked down on its
dead level, over which a wagon road passed like a scar
across a haggard face. From the brazen arch of the
sky heat poured down and was thrown back from the
scorched surface of the land. It was August in the
Utah Desert in the early fifties.</p>

<p>In the silence and deadness of the scene there was
one point of life. The canvas top of an emigrant wagon
made a white spot on the monotone of gray. At noon
there had been but one shadow in the desert and this
was that beneath the wagon which was stationary in
the road. Now the sun was declining from the zenith
and the shadow was broadening; first a mere edge,
then a substantial margin of shade.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>In it two women were crouched watching a child
that lay gasping. Some distance away beside his two
horses, a man sat on the ground, his hat over his eyes.</p>

<p>One of the thousand tragedies the desert had seen
was being enacted. Crushed between that dead indifference
of earth and sky, its participators seemed to
feel the hopelessness of movement or plaint and sat
dumb, all but the child, who was dying with that solemn
aloofness to surroundings, of which only those
who are passing know the secret. His loud breathing
sounded like a defiance in the silence of that savagely
unsympathizing nature. The man, the women, the
horses, were like part of the picture in their mute immobility,
only the dying child dared defy it.</p>

<p>He was a pretty boy of three, and had succumbed to
one of the slight, juvenile ailments that during the
rigors of the overland march developed tragic powers
of death. His mother sat beside him staring at him.
She was nineteen years of age and had been married
four years before to the man who sat in the shadow
of the horses. She looked forty, tanned, haggard,
half clad. Dazed by hardship and the blow that had
just fallen, she had the air of a stupefied animal. She
said nothing and made no attempt to alleviate the sufferings
of her first-born.</p>

<p>The other woman was some ten years older, and was
a buxom, handsome creature, large-framed, capable,
stalwart&mdash;a woman built for struggles and endurance&mdash;the
mate of the pioneer. She, too, was the wife of the
man who sat by the horses. He was of the Mormon
faith, which he had joined a year before for the purpose
of marrying her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>The sun sloped its burning course across the pale
sky. The edges of the desert shimmered through veils
of heat. Far on the horizon the mirage of a blue lake,
with little waves creeping up a crescent of sand, painted
itself on the quivering air. The shadow of the wagon
stealthily advanced. Suddenly the child moved, drew
a fluttering breath or two, and died. The two women
leaned forward, the mother helplessly; the other, with
a certain prompt decision that marked all her movements,
felt of the pulse and heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all over, Lucy,&#8221; she said bruskly, but not unkindly;
&#8220;I guess you&#8217;d better get into the wagon; Jake
and I&#8217;ll do everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl rose slowly like a person accustomed to
obey, moved to the back of the wagon, and climbed in.</p>

<p>The man, who had seen this sudden flutter of
activity, pushed back his hat and looked at his wives,
but did not move or speak. The second wife covered
the dead child with her apron, and approached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must bury him,&#8221; was her next remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right,&#8221; he assented.</p>

<p>He went to the wagon and detached from beneath it
a spade. Then he walked a few rods away and, clearing
a space in the sage, began to dig. The woman
prepared the child for burial. The silence that had
been disturbed resettled, broken at intervals by the
thud of the spade. The heat began to lessen and a
still serenity to possess the barren landscape. The
desert had received its tribute and was appeased.</p>

<p>The rites of the burial were nearly completed, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
a sound from the wagon attracted the attention of the
man and the woman. They stopped, listened and exchanged
a glance of alarmed intelligence. The woman
walked to the wagon rapidly, and exchanged a few remarks
with the other wife. Her voice came to the
man low and broken. He did not hear what she said,
but he thought he knew the purport of her words. As
he shoveled the earth into the grave his brow was contracted.
He looked angrily harassed. The second
wife came toward him, her sunburnt face set in an
expression of frowning anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, in answer to his look, &#8220;she feels very
bad. We got to stop here. We can&#8217;t go on now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made no answer, but went on building up the
mound over the grave. He was younger by a year or
two than the woman with whom he spoke, but it was
easy to be seen that of her, as of all pertaining to him,
he was absolute master. She watched him for a moment
as if waiting for an order, then, receiving none,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better go back to her. I wish a train&#8217;d come by
with a doctor. She ain&#8217;t got much strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>He vouchsafed no answer, and she returned to the
wagon, and this time climbed in.</p>

<p>He continued to build up and shape the mound with
sedulous and evidently absent-minded care. The sweat
poured off his forehead and his bare, brown throat and
breast. He was a lean but powerful man, worn away
by the journey to bone and muscle, but of an iron
fiber. He had no patience with those who hampered
his forward march by sickness or feebleness.</p>

<p>When he had finished the mound the sun was declining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
toward the tops of the distant mountains. The
first color of its setting was inflaming the sky and
painting the desert in tones of strange, hot brilliancy.
The vast, grim expanse took on a tropical aspect.
Against the lurid background the chain of hills turned
a transparent amethyst, and the livid earth, with its
leprous eruption, was transformed into a pale lilac-blue.
Presently the thin, clear red of the sunset was
pricked by a white star-point. And in the midst of
this vivid blending of limpid primary colors, the fire
the man had kindled sent a fine line of smoke straight
up into the air.</p>

<p>The second wife came out of the wagon to help him
get the supper and to eat hers. They talked a little
in low voices as they ate, drawn away from the heat
of the fire. The man showed symptoms of fatigue;
but the powerful woman was unconquered in her stubborn,
splendid vigor. When she had left him, he lay
down on the sand with his face on his arm and was
soon asleep. The sounds of dole that came from the
wagon did not wake him, nor disturb the deep dreamlessness
of his exhausted rest. The night was half
spent, when he was wakened by the woman shaking
his shoulder. He looked up at her stupidly for a minute,
seeing her head against the deep blue sky with its
large white stars.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s over. It&#8217;s a little girl. But Lucy&#8217;s pretty bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat up, fully awake now, and in the stillness of
the night heard the cat-like mew of the new-born. The
canvas arch of the wagon glowed with a fiery effect
from the lighted lanterns within.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she dying?&#8221; he said hurriedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;not&#8217;s bad as that. But she&#8217;s terribly low.
We&#8217;ll have to stay here with her till she pulls up some.
We can&#8217;t move on with her this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and, going to the wagon, looked in through
the opened flap. His wife was lying with her eyes
closed, waxen pale in the smoky lantern-light. The
sight of her shocked him into a sudden spasm of feeling.
She had been a fresh and pretty girl of fifteen
when he had married her, four years before at St.
Louis. He wondered if her father, who had given her
to him then, would have known her now. In an excess
of careless pity he laid his hand on her and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Lucy, how d&#8217;ye feel?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank from his touch and tried to draw a
corner of the blanket, on which her head rested, over
her face.</p>

<p>He turned away and walked back to the fire, saying
to the second wife:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess she&#8217;ll be able to go on to-morrow. She can
stay in the wagon all the time. I don&#8217;t want to run no
risks &#8217;er gittin&#8217; caught in the snows on the Sierra. I
guess she&#8217;ll pull herself together all right in a few days.
I&#8217;ve seen her worse &#8217;n that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where the foothills fold back upon one another in
cool, blue shadows, and the tops of the Sierra, brushed
with snow, look down on a rugged rampart of mountains
falling away to a smiling plain, Dan Moreau and
his partner had been working a stream bed since June.
Placerville&mdash;still Hangtown&mdash;though already past the
feverish days of its first youth, was some twenty-five
miles to the southwest. A few miles to the south the
emigrant trail from Carson crawled over the shoulder
of the Sierra. Small trails broke from the parent one
and trickled down from the summit, by &#8220;the line of
least resistance,&#8221; to the outposts of civilization that
were planted here and there on foothill and valley.</p>

<p>The ca&ntilde;on where Moreau and his &#8220;pard&#8221; were at
work was California, virgin and unconquered. The
forty-niners had passed it by in their eager rush for
fortune. Yet the narrow gulch, that steamed at midday
with heated airs and was steeped in the pungent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
fragrance which California exhales beneath the ardors
of the sun, was yielding the two miners a good supply
of gold. Their pits had honeycombed the stream&#8217;s
banks far up and down. Now, in September, the
water had dwindled to a silver thread, and they had
dammed it near the rocker into a miniature lake, into
which Fletcher&mdash;Moreau&#8217;s partner&mdash;plunged his dipper
with untiring regularity, at the same time moving
the rocker which filled the hot silence of the ca&ntilde;on
with its lazy monotonous rattle.</p>

<p>They had been working with little cessation since
early June. The richness of their claim and the prospect
that the first snows would put an end to labors
and profits had spurred them to unremitting exertion.
In a box under Moreau&#8217;s bunk there were six small
buckskin sacks of dust, joint profits of the summer&#8217;s
toil.</p>

<p>Moreau, a muscular, fair-haired giant of a man, was
that familiar figure of the early days&mdash;the gentleman
miner. He was a New Englander of birth and education,
who had come to California in the first rush, with
a little fortune wherewith to make a great one. Luck
had not been with him. This was his first taste of
success. Five months before he had picked up a
&#8220;pard&#8221; in Sacramento, and after the careless fashion
of the time, when no one sought to inquire too closely
into another&#8217;s antecedents, joined forces with him
and spent a wandering spring, prospecting from bar
to bar and camp to camp. The casual words of an
Indian had directed them to the ca&ntilde;on where now the
creak of their rocker filled the hot, drowsy days.</p>

<p>Of Harney Fletcher, Moreau knew nothing. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
had met him in a lodging-house in Sacramento, and the
partnership proved to be a successful one. What the
New Englander furnished in money, the other made
up in practical experience and general handiness. It
was Fletcher who had constructed the rocker on an
improved model of his own. His had been the directing
brain as well as the assisting hand which had
built the cabin of logs that surveyed the stream bed
from a knoll above. The last remnants of Moreau&#8217;s
fortune had stocked it well, and there were two good
horses in the brush shed behind it.</p>

<p>It was now September, and the leaves of the aspens
that grew along the stream bed were yellowing. But
the air was warm and golden with sunshine. Above,
in the high places of the Sierra, where the emigrant
trail crept along the edges of ravines and crawled
up the mighty flank of the wall that shuts the garden
of California from the desert beyond, the snow was
already deep. Fletcher, who had gone into Hangtown
the week before for provisions, had come back full of
stories of the swarms of emigrants pouring down the
main road and its branching trails, higgledy-piggledy,
pell-mell, hungry, gaunt, half clad, in their wild
rush to enter the land of promise.</p>

<p>There was no suggestion of winter here. The hot
air was steeped in the aromatic scents that the sun
draws from the mighty pines which clothe the foothills.
At midday the little gulley where the men
worked was heavy with them. All about them was
strangely silent. The pines rising rank on rank stirred
to no passing breezes. There was no bird note, and
the stream had shrunk so that its spring-time song had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
become a whisper. Heat and silence held the long
days, when the red dust lay motionless on the trail
above, and the noise made by the rocker sounded
strangely intrusive and loud in the enchanted stillness
that held the landscape.</p>

<p>On an afternoon like this the men were working in
the stream bed&mdash;Moreau in the pit, Fletcher at his
place by the rocker. There was no conversation between
them. The picture-like dumbness of their surroundings
seemed to have communicated itself to them.
Far above, glittering against the blue, the white peaks
of the Sierra looked down on them from remote, a&euml;rial
heights. The tiny thread of water gleamed in its
wide, unoccupied bed. Save the men, the only moving
thing in sight was a hawk that hung poised in the
sky above, its winged shadow floating forward and
pausing on the slopes of the gulch.</p>

<p>Into this spellbound silence a sound suddenly broke&mdash;a
sound unexpected and unwished for&mdash;that of a
human voice. It was a man&#8217;s, harsh and loud, evidently
addressing cattle. With it came the creak of
wheels. The two partners listened, amazed and irresolute.
The trail that passed their cabin was an almost
unknown offshoot from the main highway. Then, the
sounds growing clearer, they scrambled up the bank.
Coming down the road they saw the curved top of a
prairie schooner that formed a background for the
forms of two skeleton horses, beside which walked a
man who urged them on with shouts and blows.
Wagon and horses were enveloped in a cloud of red
dust.</p>

<p>At the moment that the miners saw this unwelcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
sight, one of the wretched beasts stumbled, and pitching
forward, fell with what sounded like a human
groan. The man, with an oath, went to it and gave
it a kick. But it was too far spent to rally, and settling
on its side, lay gasping. A woman, stout and
sunburned, ran round from the back of the cart, with
a face of angry consternation. As Moreau approached,
he heard her say to the man who, with oaths and blows,
was attempting to drag the horse to its feet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it ain&#8217;t no use doing that. Don&#8217;t you see it&#8217;s
dying?&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreau saw that she was right. The animal was in
its death throes. As he came up he said, without preliminaries:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take off its harness, the poor brute&#8217;s done for,&#8221;
and began to unbuckle the rags of harness which held
it to the wagon.</p>

<p>The man and woman turned, startled, and saw
him. Looking back they saw Fletcher, who was
coming slowly, and evidently not very willingly,
forward. The sight of the exhausted pioneers was
a too familiar one to interest him. The dying horse
claimed a lazy cast of his indifferent eye. Moreau
and the man loosed the harness, lifted the pole, and let
the creature lie free from encumbrance. The other
horse, freed, too, stood drooping, too spent to move
from where it had stopped. If other testimony were
needed of the terrible journey they were ending, one
saw it in the gaunt face of the man, scorched by sun,
seamed with lines, with a fringe of ragged beard, and
long locks of unkempt hair hanging from beneath his
miserable hat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>This stoppage of his journey with the promised
land in sight seemed to exasperate him to a point
where he evidently feared to speak. With eyes full
of savage despair he stood looking at the horse. Both
he and the woman seemed so overpowered by the
calamity that they had no attention to give to the
two strangers, but stood side by side, staring morosely
at the animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; she said hopelessly. &#8220;Spotty,&#8221; indicating
the other horse, &#8220;ain&#8217;t no use alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreau spoke up encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you leave the wagon and the other
horse here? You can walk into Hangtown by easy
stages. The Porter ranch is only twelve miles from
here and you can stay there all night. The poor beast
can&#8217;t do much more, and we&#8217;ll feed it and take care of
your other things while you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, damn it, we can&#8217;t!&#8221; said the man furiously.</p>

<p>As if in explanation of this remark, a woman suddenly
appeared at the open front of the wagon. She
had evidently been lying within it, and had not risen
until now.</p>

<p>When Moreau looked at her he experienced a violent
thrill of pity, that the evident sufferings of the
others had not evoked. He was a man of a deeply
tender and sympathetic nature toward all that was
helpless and weak. As his glance met the face of this
woman, he thought she was the most piteous object
he had ever seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better come into the cabin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
see what you can do. You can&#8217;t go on now, and you
look pretty well used up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>The man gave a grunt of assent, and taking the
other horse by the head began to lead it toward the
cabin, being noticeably careful to steer it out of the
way of all stumbling-blocks. The woman in the sunbonnet
called to her companion in the wagon:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Lucy, get a move on! We&#8217;re going to stop
and rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus addressed, the woman moved to the back of
the cart, drew the flap aside and slipped out. She
came behind the others, and Moreau, looking back,
saw that she walked slowly, as if feeble, or in pain.</p>

<p>Advancing to the sunbonneted figure in front of
him he said, with a backward jerk of his head:
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with her? Is she sick?&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman gave an indifferent glance backward.
Like the man, she seemed completely preoccupied by
their disaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but she has been. But
good Lord!&#8221;&mdash;with a sudden burst of angry bitterness&mdash;&#8220;women
like her ain&#8217;t meant to take them sort of
journeys. If it weren&#8217;t for her, Jake and I could go
on all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She relapsed into silence as the cabin revealed itself
through the trees. It appeared to interest her, and she
went to the door and looked in.</p>

<p>It was the typical miner&#8217;s cabin of the period, consisting
of a single room with two bunks. Opposite
the doorway was the wide-mouthed chimney, a slab
of rock before it doing duty as hearthstone. There
was an armchair formed of a barrel, cushioned with
red flannel and mounted on rockers. Moreau&#8217;s bunk
was covered with a miner&#8217;s blanket, and the ineradicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
habits of the gentleman spoke in the very simple
but sufficient toilet accessories that stood on a shelf
under a tiny square of looking-glass. Over the roof
a great pine spread its boughs, and in passing through
these the slightest breaths of air made soft eolian murmurings.
To the pioneers, the wild, rough place
looked the ideal of comfort and luxury.</p>

<p>A small spring bubbled up near the roots of the
pine and trickled across the space in front of the
cabin. To this, by common consent, the party made
its way. The exhausted horse plunged its nose in the
cool current and drank and snorted and drank again.
The elder woman knelt down and laved her face and
neck and even the top of her head in the water. The
man stood looking with a moody eye at his broken
animal, and joined by Fletcher, they talked over its
condition. The miner, versed in this as in all practical
matters, deemed the beast incapacitated for journeys
of any length for some time to come. Both animals
had been driven to the limit of their strength.</p>

<p>The pioneer asserted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to get acrost before the snows blocked us,
and they&#8217;re heavy up there now,&#8221; with a nod of his
head toward the mountains above; &#8220;then I wanted to
get down into the settlements as soon&#8217;s I could. I
knew there weren&#8217;t two more days work in &#8217;em, but
I calk&#8217;lated they&#8217;d get me in. After that it didn&#8217;t
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only thing for you to do is to walk into Hangtown,
buy a mule there, and come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man made a despairing gesture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;How the hell can I, with her?&#8221; he said, indicating
the younger woman.</p>

<p>Fletcher turned round and surveyed her with a cold,
exploring eye where she had sunk down on the roots
of the pine, with her back against its trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks pretty well tuckered out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Your
wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other one&#8217;s your sister?&#8221; he continued
with glib curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s my wife, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The inquirer, who was used to such plurality on the
part of the Utah emigrants, gave a whistle and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mormons, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man nodded.</p>

<p>Meantime Moreau had entered the cabin to get some
food and drink to offer the sick woman. In a few
moments he reappeared carrying a tin cup containing
whisky diluted with water from the spring, and approached
the woman sitting by the tree trunk. Her
eyes were closed and she presented a deathlike appearance.
The shawl she had worn round her shoulders
had fallen back and disclosed a small bundle that she
held with a loose carefulness. The man noticed the
way her arms were disposed about it and wondered.
Coming to a standstill before her, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you something that&#8217;ll brace you up.
Would you like to try it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her lids and looked at him, and then at
the cup. As he met her glance he noticed that her
eyes were a clear brown like a dog&#8217;s, and for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
first time he realized that she might be young. She
stretched out her hand obediently and taking the cup
drank a little, then silently gave it back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a pretty rough time I guess,&#8221; he said,
holding the cup which he intended to give her again
in a minute.</p>

<p>She nodded. Then suddenly the tears began to
well out of her eyes, quantities of tears that ran in a
flood over her cheeks. She did not sob or attempt to
hide her face, but leaning her head against the tree, let
the tears flow as though lost to everything but her
sense of misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, poor thing! poor thing!&#8221; he exclaimed in a
burst of sympathy, &#8220;you&#8217;re half dead. Here take some
more of this,&#8221; and he pressed the cup into her hand,
not knowing what else to do for her.</p>

<p>She took it, and then, through the tears, he saw her
cast a look of furtive alarm toward her husband.
She was within his line of vision and tried to shift herself
behind Moreau.</p>

<p>With a sensation of angry disgust he understood
that she feared this unkempt and haggard creature
to whom she belonged. He moved so that he sheltered
her and watched her try to drink again. But her tears
blinded her and she handed the cup back with a shaking
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been too much,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;If I could only
have died! My boy did. Out there on them awful
plains where there ain&#8217;t a tree and it&#8217;s hot like a furnace.
And they buried him there&mdash;Bessie and he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bessie and he?&#8221; he repeated vaguely, his pity entirely
preoccupying his mind for the moment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;Yes, Bessie,&mdash;the second wife. I&#8217;m the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he said, comprehending, &#8220;you&#8217;re from Utah?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; she answered quickly, &#8220;I&#8217;m from Indiana.
I&#8217;m no Mormon. He wasn&#8217;t neither till he married
Bessie. He wanted her and he did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she was suddenly interrupted by a weak whining
cry from the bundle that one arm still curved
about. She bent her head and drew back the covering,
and Moreau saw a strange wizened face and a tiny,
claw-like hand feeling feebly about. He had never
seen a very young infant before and it seemed to him
a weirdly hideous thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it yours?&#8221; he said, amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;it was born in the desert
three weeks ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tears were dry, and she bent over the feeble
thing that squirmed weakly and made small, cat-like
noises, with something in her attitude that changed
her and made her still a woman who had a life above
her miseries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to go into the cabin?&#8221; said the
man, feeling suddenly abashed by his ignorance of all
pertaining to this infinitesimal bit of life. &#8220;You might
want to wash it or put it to sleep or give it something
to eat. There&#8217;s a basin and soap and&mdash;er&mdash;some flour
and bacon in there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman responded to the invitation with a slight
show of alacrity. She stumbled as she rose, and he
took her arm and guided her. At the cabin door he
left her and as he passed to the back where the rest
of the party had gone, the baby&#8217;s feeble cry, weak, but
insistent, followed him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The emigrant, Bessie and Fletcher, had repaired to
the brush shed where Moreau&#8217;s horses were stabled and
had put the half-dead Spotty under its shelter. Here
the exhausted beast had lain down. The trio had then
betaken themselves to a bare spot on the shaded slope
of the knoll and were eating ship&#8217;s biscuits and drinking
whisky and water from a tin cup, that circulated
from hand to hand. As Moreau approached he could
hear his partner volubly expatiating on the barrenness
of the stream-beds in the vicinity. The stranger
was listening to him with a cogitating eye, his seamed,
weather-worn face set in an expression of frowning
attention. Her hunger appeased, Bessie had curled up
on her side, and with her sunbonnet still on, had fallen
into a deep, healthy sleep.</p>

<p>Moreau joined them, and listened with mingled surprise
and amusement to Fletcher&#8217;s glib lies. Then,
when his partner&#8217;s fluency was exhausted, he questioned
the emigrant on his trip. The man&#8217;s answers
were short and non-committal. He seemed in a morose,
savage state at his ill luck, his mind still engrossed by
the question of moving on.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d money,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;d give you anything you&#8217;d
ask for them two horses &#8217;er your&#8217;n in the shed. But
I ain&#8217;t a thing to give&mdash;not a red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife, your other wife,&#8221; said Moreau, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t
seem to me fit to go on. She&#8217;s dead beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gave an angry snort.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been like that pretty near the whole way,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s been put back because of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He relapsed into moody silence and then said suddenly:
&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; if she&#8217;s got to walk.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>Moreau went back to the cabin. They had half
killed the woman already; now if they insisted on her
walking the wretched creature might collapse altogether.
Would they leave her on the mountain roads,
he wondered?</p>

<p>He reached the cabin door, knocked and heard her
answering &#8220;come in.&#8221; She was sitting on an upturned
box beside the bunk on which the baby slept. Her sunbonnet
was off, and he noticed that she had bright hair,
rippled and thick, and of the same reddish-brown color
as her eyes. She had washed away the traces of her
tears, but her clothes, hardly sufficient covering for
her lean, toil-worn body, were dirty and ragged. No
beggar he had ever seen in the distant New England
town where he had spent his boyhood, had presented
a more miserable appearance. She looked timidly at
him and rose from the box, pushing it toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put the baby on the bunk,&#8221; she said apologetically,
&#8220;but I can hold her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t disturb her,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
only place you could have put her.&#8221; Then, seeing her
standing, he said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat charily and evidently ill at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve been eating out there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I
thought you might like something, too. There&#8217;s some
stuff over there in the corner if you&#8217;ll wait a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the corner where the supplies were
stored and rifled them for more ship&#8217;s biscuit and a
wedge of cheese, a delicacy which Fletcher had
brought from Hangtown on his last visit, and which
he carefully refrained from offering to the hungry
emigrants. Coming back with these he drew out another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
box and spread them on it before her. She
looked on in heavy, silent surprise. When he had finished
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;fall to. You want food as much as anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no effort to eat, and he said, disappointed:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want it? Oh, make a try.&#8221;</p>

<p>She &#8220;made a try,&#8221; and bit off a piece of cracker,
while he again retired to the supply corner for the tin
cup and the whisky. He tried to step softly so as not
to wake the child, and there was something ludicrous
in the sight of this vast, bearded man, with his mighty,
half-bared arms and muscular throat, trying to be
noiseless, with as much success as one might expect
of a bear.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of her repast, the woman
broke down completely; and, with bowed head, she
was shaken by a tempest of some violent emotion. It
was not like her tears of an hour before, which seemed
merely an indication of physical exhaustion. This was
an expression of spiritual tumult. Sobs rent her and
she rocked back and forth struggling with some fierce
paroxysm.</p>

<p>Moreau, cup in hand, gazed at her in distracted
helplessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, eat a little,&#8221; he said coaxingly, not
knowing what else to suggest, and then getting no response:
&#8220;Suppose you lie down on the bunk? Rest
is what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t go on,&#8221; she groaned. &#8220;I can&#8217;t. How
can I? Oh, it&#8217;s too much! I can&#8217;t go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent before this ill for which he had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
remedy, and she wailed again in the agony of her spirit:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t. If I could only die! But now
there&#8217;s the baby, and I can&#8217;t even die.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up feeling sick at heart at sight of this hopeless
despair. What could he suggest to the unfortunate
creature? He felt that anything he could say
would be an insult in the face of such a position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh God, why can&#8217;t we die?&#8221; she groaned&mdash;&#8220;why
can&#8217;t we die?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she said the words the sound of approaching
voices came through the open door. Her husband&#8217;s
struck through her agony and froze it. She stiffened
and lifted her face full of an animal look of listening.
Moreau noticed her blunt and knotted hands, pitiful
in their record of toil, as she held them up in the transfixed
attitude of strained attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now?&#8221; she said to herself.</p>

<p>The pioneer, Fletcher and Bessie came slowly round
the corner of the cabin. Bessie looked sleepily anxious,
Fletcher lazily amused. As Moreau stepped out of
the doorway toward them he realized that they had
come to some decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the man, &#8220;we got to travel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going on?&#8221; said Moreau. &#8220;How about the
wagon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re goin&#8217; to leave the wagon, and I&#8217;ll come back
for it from Hangtown. It&#8217;s the only thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He calk&#8217;lates,&#8221; said Fletcher, &#8220;to mount his wife&mdash;the
peaked one&mdash;on the horse and take her along till
one or other of &#8217;em drops.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;Take your wife on that horse?&#8221; exclaimed Moreau.
&#8220;Why, it can&#8217;t go two miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe it can&#8217;t,&#8221; returned the man with an
immovable face.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Moreau was conscious that the
woman was standing behind him in the doorway. He
could hear her breathing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Lucy,&#8221; said the husband. &#8220;We got to
move on sometime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here the second wife spoke up:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how the horse is goin&#8217; to get Lucy
twelve miles, and this man says the first place we can
stop is twelve miles farther along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you begin with your everlasting objections,&#8221;
said the husband, furiously. &#8220;Get the horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman evidently knew the time had passed for
trifling and turned away toward the brush shed.
Fletcher followed her with a grin. The situation appealed
to his sense of humor, and he was curious as
to the outcome.</p>

<p>Moreau and the emigrant were left facing each
other, with the first wife in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wife&#8217;s not able to go on,&#8221; said the miner&mdash;his
manner becoming suddenly authoritative; &#8220;no more
than your horse is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;but they&#8217;re both goin&#8217;
to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But can&#8217;t you see the horse can&#8217;t carry her? She
certainly can&#8217;t walk into Hangtown, or even to Porter&#8217;s
Ranch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t see. And how&#8217;s it come to be your
business&mdash;what they can do or what they can&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;YOUR WIFE&#8217;S NOT ABLE TO GO ON, NO MORE THAN YOUR<br />
HORSE IS&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s any one&#8217;s business to prevent a woman from
being half killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you seem to think so much about her, why
don&#8217;t you keep her here yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man spoke with a savage sneer, his eyes full of
steely defiance.</p>

<p>Before he had realized the full import of his words,
burning with rage against the brutal tyrant to whom
the wife was of no more moment than the horse,
Moreau answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will&mdash;let her stay!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. The emigrant&#8217;s face,
dark with rage, was suddenly lightened by a curiously
alert expression of intelligence. He looked at the
woman in the background and then at the miner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not giving anything away just now,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;When she&#8217;s well she&#8217;s of use. But I&#8217;ll swap
her for your two horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the heat of his indignation and disgust Moreau
turned and looked at the woman. She was leaning
against the door frame, chalk-white, and staring at
him. She made no sound, but her dog-like eyes seemed
to speak for his mercy more eloquently than her tongue
ever could.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done,&#8221; said the emigrant. &#8220;You&#8217;ll find her a good
worker when she pulls herself together. You stay on
here, Lucy. Bessie,&#8221; he sang out, &#8220;bring around them
horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under the phlegm of his manner there was a sudden
expanding heat of shame that he strove to hide.
The woman neither stirred nor spoke, and Moreau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
stood with his back to her, struggling with his passion
against the man who had been her owner. The impulse
under which he had spoken had full possession
of him, and his main feeling was his desire to rid himself
of the emigrant and his other wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;go on and tell them that you&#8217;ll
take the horses. Hurry up!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man needed no second bidding and made off
rapidly round the corner of the cabin.</p>

<p>Moreau and the woman were silent. For the moment
he had forgotten her presence, engrossed by the
rage that filled his warmly generous nature. Instinctively
he followed the man to the angle of the cabin
whence he could command the brush shed. The trio
were standing there, Fletcher and the woman listening
amazed to the emigrant&#8217;s explanation. Moreau turned
back to the cabin and his eye fell on the woman in
the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said&mdash;trying to speak easily&mdash;&#8220;you don&#8217;t
mind staying on here for a while, do you? I guess
we can make you comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer, and after waiting a moment he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When you get stronger I&#8217;ll be able to find you something
to do in Hangtown. You know you couldn&#8217;t
go on, feeling so bad. And this air round here&#8221;&mdash;with
a wave of his hand to the surrounding pines&mdash;&#8220;will
brace you up finely.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a murmured sound of assent, but more
than this made no reply. Only her dog-like eyes again
seemed to speak. Their miserable look of gratitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
made Moreau uncomfortable and he could think of
nothing more to say.</p>

<p>The sound of the trio advancing from the shed came
as a welcome interruption. They appeared round the
corner of the cabin, leading the miner&#8217;s two powerful
and well-fed horses. Evidently the situation had been
explained. Fletcher&#8217;s face was enigmatical. The humorousness
of the novel exchange had come a little
too close to his own comfort to be quite as full of
zest as it had been earlier in the afternoon. He had
insisted that the emigrant leave his horse, which the
man had no objection to doing. Bessie looked flushed
and excited. Moreau thought he detected shame and
disapproval under her agitated demeanor. But to her
work was a matter of second nature. She put the
horses to the tongue of the wagon and buckled the
rags of harness together before she turned for a last
word to her companion. This was characteristically
brief:</p>

<p>&#8220;So long, Lucy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;let&#8217;s see the baby again.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was shown her and she kissed it on the forehead
with some tenderness. Then she climbed on the wheel
of the wagon and took from the interior a bundle tied
up in printed calico and laid it on the ground. It contained
all the personal belongings and wardrobe of the
first wife. There were a few murmured sentences between
them and then she turned to ascend to her seat.
But before she had fairly mounted a sudden impulse
seized her and whirled her back to give Lucy a good-by
kiss.</p>

<p>There was more feeling in this action than in anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
that had passed between the trio during the afternoon.
The two wives had been women who had mutually
suffered. There were tears in Bessie&#8217;s eyes as
she climbed to her place. The husband never turned
his head in the direction of his first wife. But as he
took the reins and prepared to start the team, he called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good by, Lucy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He clucked at the horses, and the wagon moved
forward amid a stir of red dust. The woman on the
front seat drew her sunbonnet over her face. The
man beside her looked neither to the right nor the
left, but stared out over his newly-acquired team with
an impassively set visage. His long whip curled out
with a hiss, the spirited animals gave a forward bound,
and the wagon went clattering and jolting down the
trail.</p>

<p>Moreau stood watching its canvas arch go swinging
downward under the dark boughs of the pines and the
flickering foliage of the aspens. He watched until a
bend in the road hid it. Then he turned toward the
cabin. Fletcher was standing behind him, surveying
him with a cold and sardonic eye:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve done it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil are you going to do with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the horses gone; nothin&#8217; but that busted cayuse
left!&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other, Fletcher angrily
incredulous, Moreau smilingly deprecating and apologetic.</p>

<p>As they stood thus, neither knowing what to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the emigrant&#8217;s wife appeared at the doorway of the
cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get your supper now if it&#8217;s the right time,&#8221; she
said timidly.</p>

<p>That night the two miners rolled themselves in their
blankets and lay down on the expanse of slippery
grass under the pine. Moreau did not sleep soon.
The day&#8217;s incidents were the first interruption to the
monotony of their uneventful summer.</p>

<p>Now, the strong man, lying on his back, looking at
the large white stars between the pine boughs, thought
of what he had done with perplexity, but without regret.
In the still peacefulness of the night he turned
over in his mind what he should do when the woman
grew stronger. Women were rare in the mining districts,
and he knew that the emigrant wife could earn
high wages as a servant either in Hangtown or the
growing metropolis of Sacramento. The child might
hamper her, but he could help her to take care of the
child until she got fairly on her feet. He had nothing
much to do with his &#8220;dust.&#8221; Strong and young and
in California, that always meant money enough.</p>

<p>So he thought, pushing uneasiness from his mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Turning on his hard bed he could see the dark bulk of
the cabin with a glint of starlight on its window.
Above, the black boughs of the pine made a network
against the sky sown with stars of an extraordinary
size and luster. He could hear the river sleepily murmuring
to itself. Once, far off, in the higher mountains,
the shrill, weird cry of a California lion tore the
silence. He rose on his elbow, looking toward the
cabin. The sound was a terrifying one, and he was
prepared to see the woman come out, frightened, and
had the words of reassurance ready to call to her.
But there was no movement from the little hut. She
was evidently wrapped in the sleep of utter fatigue.</p>

<p>In the morning he was down at a basin scooped in
the stream bed making a hasty toilet, when Fletcher,
sleepy-eyed and yawning, came slipping over the bank.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we goin&#8217; to do for breakfast?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Is that purchase o&#8217; your&#8217;n goin&#8217; to git it? She&#8217;d
oughter do something to show she&#8217;s worth the two
best horses this side er Hangtown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreau, with his hair and beard bedewed with his
ducking, was about to answer when a sound from
above attracted them.</p>

<p>Lucy was standing on the bank. In the clear morning
light she looked white and pinched. Her wretched
clothes of yesterday, a calico sack and skirt, were augmented
by a clean apron of blue check. Her skirt was
short and showed her feet in a pair of rusty shoes
that were so large they might have been her husband&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you comin&#8217; to breakfast?&#8221; she said; &#8220;it&#8217;s
ready.&#8221; Then she disappeared. The men looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
each other and Moreau shook the drops from his beard
and began to try to pat his hair into order. The civilizing
influence of woman&mdash;even such an unlovely
woman as the emigrant&#8217;s wife&mdash;was beginning its
work.</p>

<p>Lucy had evidently been busy. The litter that had
disfigured the ground in front of the cabin was cleared
away. Through the open door and window a current
of resinous mountain air passed which counteracted
the effect of the fire. Nevertheless she had evidently
feared its heat would be oppressive, and had brought
two of the boxes to the rude bench outside the doorway,
and on these the breakfast was laid. It was of
the simplest&mdash;fried bacon, coffee and hot biscuits&mdash;but
the scent of these, hot and appetizing, was sweet
in the nostrils of the hungry men.</p>

<p>Sitting on the bench, they fell to and were not disappointed.
The emigrant&#8217;s wife had evidently great
skill in the preparation of the simple food of the
pioneer. With the scanty means at her hand she had
concocted a meal that to the men, used to their own
primitive cooking, seemed the most toothsome they
had eaten since they left San Francisco.</p>

<p>As she retired into the cabin, Fletcher&mdash;his mouth
full of biscuit&mdash;said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she can cook anyway. I wonder how she
gets her biscuits so all-fired light? They ain&#8217;t all
saleratus, neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she reappeared, carrying the coffee-pot, and,
leaning over Fletcher&#8217;s shoulder, prepared to refill his
tin cup.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Put it down on the table. He can do it himself,&#8221;
commanded Moreau suddenly.</p>

<p>She set it down instantly, with her invariable
frightened obedience.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not used to being waited on,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;Now you sit down here,&#8221;&mdash;he rose from his end of the
bench and pointed to it,&mdash;&#8220;and next thing we want I&#8217;ll
go in and get it. You&#8217;ve had your own breakfast, of
course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I ain&#8217;t had mine yet,&#8221; she answered meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he almost shouted. &#8220;What
d&#8217;ye mean by giving us ours first?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked terrified and shrank a little on the bench.
Moreau had a dreadful idea that for a moment she was
afraid of being struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, take this cup,&#8221; he said, giving her his,&mdash;&#8220;and
this bacon,&#8221; picking from the pan, which stood in the
middle of the table, the choicest pieces, and a biscuit.
&#8220;There&mdash;now eat. I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to eat, but it was evidently difficult. Her
hands, bent and disfigured with work, shook. At intervals
she cast a furtive, questioning look at him
where he sat on an overturned box, eying her with
good-humored interest. As he met the frightened
dog-eyes he smiled encouragingly, but she was grave
and returned to her breakfast with nervous haste.</p>

<p>As the men descended the bank to the stream bed,
Fletcher said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she&#8217;s some use in the world. That&#8217;s the first
decent meal we&#8217;ve had since we left Sacramento.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t eat much of it herself,&#8221; returned his
pard as he began the morning&#8217;s work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;She is the gol-darnedest lookin&#8217; woman I ever seen.
Looks as if she&#8217;d been fed on shavings. I&#8217;ll lay ten
to one that emigrant cuss she b&#8217;longs to has &#8217;most
beat the life out er her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ascending to the cabin an hour later, Moreau came
upon the woman, washing the breakfast dishes in the
stream that trickled from the spring. She did not
hear him approach, and, watching her, he saw that
she was slow and feeble in her movements. The sun
spattered down through the pine boughs on her thick,
brilliant-colored hair, and on the nape of her neck,
where the skin was tanned to a coarse, russet brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing that for?&#8221; he said, coming to
a standstill in front of her. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t bother about
the pans.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d oughter be cleaned,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to feel,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you&#8217;ve got
to work all the time. I wanted you to rest up a bit.
It&#8217;s a good place to rest here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer, drying the tin cups on a piece
of flour sack.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so awful tired,&#8221; she said presently in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you worry about having everything so
clean; they&#8217;ll do anyway. And the cabin&#8217;s pretty
clean,&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked, somewhat anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;awful clean,&#8221; she said. Then, after a moment,
she continued: &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t oughter have stayed
in the cabin. It&#8217;s your&#8217;n. Me and the baby&#8217;ll be all
right in the brush shed with Spotty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What nonsense!&#8221; retorted Moreau. &#8220;Do you suppose
I&#8217;d let you and that baby stay in the brush shed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the place where the horses have been kept all summer?
You&#8217;re going to keep the cabin, and if there&#8217;s anything
you want&mdash;anything that&#8217;s short, or that you might
need for the baby&mdash;why, Fletcher&#8217;ll go to Hangtown
and get it. Just say what you want. Not having
women around, we&#8217;re probably short of all sorts
of little fixings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want nothing,&#8221; she said with her head
down&mdash;&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never been so comfortable sence I was
married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been married long?&#8221; he asked, less from
curiosity than from the desire to make her talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four years,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;I was married in St.
Louis, just before dad and I was startin&#8217; to cross the
plains. Dad was taken sick. He was consumpted,
and some one tol&#8217; him to go to California, so we was
goin&#8217; to start along with a heap of other folks. We
was all waitin&#8217; &#8217;round St. Louis for the weather to
settle and that&#8217;s how I met Jake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake?&#8221; said Moreau, interrogatively; &#8220;who was
Jake?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband&mdash;Jake Shackleton. He was one o&#8217;
the drivers of the train. He drove McGinnes&#8217; teams.
He was there in camp with us, and up and asked me,
and dad was glad to get any one to take care of me,
bein&#8217; as he was so consumpted. We was married a
week afore the train started. I didn&#8217;t favor it much,
but dad thought it was a good thing. My father was
a Methodist preacher, and knowin&#8217; as how he couldn&#8217;t
last long, he was powerful glad to get some one to
look after me. I was pretty young to be left&mdash;just
fifteen.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;Fifteen!&#8221; echoed Moreau&mdash;then piecing together
her scant bits of biography&mdash;&#8220;Then you&#8217;re only <i>nineteen</i>
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my age,&#8221; she said with her laconic dryness.</p>

<p>He looked at her in incredulous amaze. Nineteen!
A girl, almost a child! A gush of pity and horror
welled up in him, and for the moment he could find
no words. She went on, evidently desirous of telling
him of herself as in duty bound to her new master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad died before we got to Salt Lake. Then Jake
and I settled there and Willie was born, and for two
years it wern&#8217;t so bad. Jake liked me and was good
to me. But he got to know the Mormons and kep&#8217;
sayin&#8217; all the time it weren&#8217;t no good doin&#8217; anything
not bein&#8217; a Mormon. He said they had no use for
him, bein&#8217; a Gentile. And then he seen Bessie,&mdash;she
was a waitress in the Sunset Hotel,&mdash;and got powerful
set on her. She was a big, strong woman, and could
work. Not like me. I couldn&#8217;t never work except
in the house. I was no good for outdoor work. I
was always a sort er drag, he said. So he turned Mormon
and married Bessie, and she came to live with
us.&#8221; She stopped and began rubbing a pan with a
piece of flour sack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell any more if you don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; said the
man, hearing his voice slightly husky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she answered with her colorless,
unemotional intonation; &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t ever come to feel
she was his wife, too. I hadn&#8217;t them notions. My
father was a preacher. I hated it all, but I couldn&#8217;t
seem to think of anything else to do. I had to stay.
There was no one to go to. Dad was dead and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
didn&#8217;t have no relations. Then we started to come
here, and on the way my little boy died. That was
all I had, and I didn&#8217;t care then what happened. And
only for the other baby I&#8217;d er crep&#8217; out er the wagon
some night and run away and got lost on them plains.
But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped and made a gesture of extending her
hands outward and then letting them fall at her sides.
It was tragic in its complete hopelessness. Of gratitude
to Moreau she seemed to have little. She had
been so beaten down by misfortune that nothing was
left in her but acquiescence. Her very service to him
seemed an instinctive thing, the result of rigorous
training.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said after a pause, &#8220;you&#8217;ve had a hard
time. But it&#8217;s over now. Don&#8217;t you think about it
any more. You&#8217;re going to rest up here, and when
you&#8217;re strong and well again we&#8217;ll think about something
for you to do. Time enough for that then.
But you can always get work and high pay in Hangtown
or Sacramento. Or if you don&#8217;t fancy it at any
of those places I&#8217;ll see to it that you go down to San
Francisco. Don&#8217;t bother any more anyhow. You&#8217;d
about got to the bottom of things and now you&#8217;re
coming up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gathered up her pans and said dully: &#8220;Thank
you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cry of the baby struck on her ear and she
scrambled to her feet, and without more words turned
and walked to the cabin.</p>

<p>At dinner she again made her appearance on the
bank and called the two men. Again they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
greeted by a meal that was singularly appetizing, considering
the limited resources. Obeying Moreau&#8217;s
order, she sat down with them, but ate nothing, at intervals
starting to her feet to return to the cabin, then
restraining the impulse and sitting rigid and uncomfortable
on the upturned box. To wait on the men
seemed the only thing she knew how to do, or that
gave her ease in the doing.</p>

<p>The child cried once or twice during dinner, and, in
the afternoon, working in the pit which was in the
stream bed just below the cabin window, Moreau
heard it crying again. It seemed a louder and more
imperious cry than it had given previously. The
miner, whose knowledge of infancy and its ills was of
the most limited, wondered if it could be sick.</p>

<p>At sunset, the day&#8217;s work over, both men mounted
the bank, their takings of dust in two tin cups, from
which it was transferred to the buckskin sacks in the
box under the bunk. Moreau entered the cabin to
get the sacks and found Lucy there curled on the end
of the bunk where the baby slept. As his great bulk
darkened the door she started up, with her invariable
frightened look of apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move&mdash;don&#8217;t move,&#8221; he said, kneeling by
her; &#8220;I want to get the box under the bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started up, and being nearer the box than he,
thrust her hand under and tried to pull it out. It was
heavy with the sacks of dust and required a wrench.
She rose from the effort, gave a gasp, and, reeling,
fell against him. He caught her in his arms, and as
her head fell back against his shoulder saw that she
was death-white and unconscious.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>With terrified care he laid her on Fletcher&#8217;s bunk,
and, seizing a pan of water, sprinkled her face and
hands, then tore one of the tin cups off its nail, and,
pouring whisky into it, tried to force it between her
lips. A little entered her mouth, though most of it ran
down her chin. As he stood staring at her, Fletcher
appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he said; &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter with her? By
gum, but she looks bad!&#8221; And then, with a quick
and practised hand, he pulled her up to a sitting posture,
and, prying her mouth open with a fork, poured
some of the whisky down. It revived her quickly.
She sat up, felt for her sunbonnet, and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t oughter have done that, but it came so
quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to get up, but Moreau pushed her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I ain&#8217;t sick,&#8221; she said, trying to speak bravely;
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been took like that before. It&#8217;s just tiredness.
I&#8217;m all right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She again tried to rise, stood on her feet for a moment,
then reeled back on the bunk, with white lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a weakness,&#8221; she whispered; &#8220;such a
weakness!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the baby woke up, and, lifting up its
voice, began a loud, violent wail. The woman looked
in terror from one man to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor baby!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;what&#8217;ll I do? Is
that one goin&#8217; to go, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The baby&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Moreau. &#8220;Don&#8217;t begin
to worry about that. All babies cry, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor baby!&#8221; she wailed, unheeding, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
suddenly beginning to wring her hands. &#8220;It&#8217;ll die like
Willie. It&#8217;ll die, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should it die? What&#8217;s the matter with it?
It was all right this morning, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he answered,
feeling that there were mysteries here he did not
grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll die because it don&#8217;t get nothing to eat,&#8221; she
cried desperately. &#8220;I&#8217;ve nothing for it. I&#8217;m too sick!
I&#8217;m too sick! And it&#8217;ll starve. Oh, my poor baby!&#8221;</p>

<p>She burst into the wild, weak tears of exhaustion,
her sobs mingling with the now strident yells of the
hungry baby.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, sheepishly, beginning
to understand the situation. The enfeebled
condition of the mother made it impossible for her to
nourish the child. It was a predicament for which
even the resourceful mind of Fletcher had no remedy.
He pushed back his cap, and, scratching slowly at the
front of his head, looked at his mate with solemn perplexity,
while the cabin echoed to sounds of misery
unlike any that had ever before resounded within its
peaceful walls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&mdash;can&mdash;we get anything?&#8221; said Moreau at
length&mdash;&#8220;any&mdash;any&mdash;sort of food, meat, eggs&mdash;er&mdash;er
any sort of stuff for it to eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat?&#8221; exclaimed Fletcher scornfully; &#8220;how can it
eat? It hasn&#8217;t a tooth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would it do if Fletcher went into Hangtown
and brought the doctor?&#8221; suggested Moreau, soothingly.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll take twenty-four hours, but he&#8217;s a good
doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman shook her head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;A goat,&#8221; she sobbed, the menace to her offspring
having given her a fictitious courage. &#8220;If you could
get a goat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A goat!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, horror-stricken
at the magnitude of the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;She might as well ask us to get an elephant,&#8221; muttered
Fletcher morosely. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a goat nearer
than San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it would take us two weeks anyway to get
one up from there and across the mountains from Sacramento,&#8221;
said Moreau.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the time you got it here it&#8217;d be the most expensive
goat you ever bucked up against,&#8221; said his
partner disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cow!&#8221; exclaimed Moreau. &#8220;Say, Lucy, would
a cow do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cow!&#8221; came the muffled answer; &#8220;oh, it don&#8217;t
need a whole cow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a cow would do? If I could get a cow the
baby could be fed on the milk, couldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; it &#8217;ud do first-rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll get a cow. Don&#8217;t you bother any
more; I&#8217;ll have a cow here by to-morrow noon. The
baby&#8217;ll have to hold out till then, for, not having a
decent horse, I can&#8217;t get it here any sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where do you calk&#8217;late to get a cow?&#8221; demanded
Fletcher; &#8220;cows ain&#8217;t much more common
than goats round these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;On the Porter ranch. It&#8217;s twelve miles off. I can
go in to-night, rest there a bit, and by noon be here
with the cow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that baby goin&#8217; to yell like this from now
till to-morrow noon? You might&#8217;s well have a
mountain lion tied up in the bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The difficulty was indeed only half solved. The infant&#8217;s
lusty cries were unabated. The miserable
mother, with tear-drenched face and quivering chin,
sat up in the bunk and tried to rise and go to it, but
was restrained by Moreau&#8217;s hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay here and I&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; he said, then crossed
to the other bunk, and gingerly lifted with his huge,
hairy hands the shrieking bundle, from which protruded
two tiny, red fists, jerking and clawing about,
and carried it to its mother. Her practised hand
hushed it for a moment, but its pangs were beyond temporary
alleviation, and its cries soon broke forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could git up and mix it some flour and water,&#8221;
she said, feebly attempting to rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with us doing that?&#8221; queried
Moreau. &#8220;How do you do it? Just give us the proportions
and we&#8217;ll dish it up as if we were born to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under her direction he put flour in one of the dippers,
and handed Fletcher a tin cup with the order to
fill it with water at the spring. Both men were deeply
interested, and Fletcher rushed back from the spring
with a dripping cup, as if fearful that the infant would
die unless the work of feeding was promptly begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now go on,&#8221; said Moreau, armed with the dipper
and a tin teaspoon; &#8220;what&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sugar,&#8221; she said; &#8220;if you put a touch of sugar in
it tastes better to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, sugar. Hand it over quick. Now, there
we are. How do you mix &#8217;em, Lucy?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>She gave the directions, which the men carefully
followed, compounding a white, milky-looking liquid.
The crucial moment came when they had to feed this
to the crimson and convulsively screaming baby.</p>

<p>To forward matters better they moved two boxes to
the doorway, where the glow of sunset streamed in,
and seated themselves, Fletcher with the dipper and
spoon, Moreau with the baby. Both heads were lowered,
both faces eagerly earnest when the first spoonful
was administered. It was a tense moment till the
tip of the spoon was inserted between the infant&#8217;s lips.
Her puckered face took on a look of rather annoyed
surprise; she caught at it, and then, with an audible
smack, slowly drew in the counterfeit. The men
looked at each other with heated triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Takes it like a little man, doesn&#8217;t she?&#8221; said Moreau
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t hungry,&#8221; said Fletcher. &#8220;Oh-h, no!
Listen to her smack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, hold up the dipper. Don&#8217;t keep her waiting
when she&#8217;s so blamed hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re spilling half of it. You&#8217;re getting it on
her clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she don&#8217;t want to eat any faster. That&#8217;s
the way she likes to eat&mdash;just slowly suck it out of the
spoon. Take your time, old girl, even if you don&#8217;t
swallow it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My! don&#8217;t she take it down nice! Look alive there,
it&#8217;s running outer the corner of her mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us that bit of flour sack behind you. We
ought to have put something round her neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>The baby, its round eyes intent, one small red fist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
still fanning the air, sucked noisily at the tip of the
spoon. The mother, sitting up on the bunk in the
background, watched it with craned neck and jealous
eye.</p>

<p>Finally, when the meal was over, it was triumphantly
handed back to her, sticky from end to end, but sleepy
and satisfied.</p>

<p>A few hours later, in the star-sown darkness of the
early night, Moreau started on his twelve-mile walk
to the Porter ranch. The next morning, some time
before midday, he reappeared, red and perspiring, but
proudly leading by a rope a lean and dejected-looking
cow.</p>

<p>The problem of the baby&#8217;s nutriment was now satisfactorily
solved. The cow proved eminently fitted for
the purpose of its purchase, and though the two miners
had several unsuccessful bouts in learning to milk it,
the handy Fletcher soon overcame this difficulty, and
the stock of the cabin was augmented by fresh milk.</p>

<p>The baby throve upon this nourishment. Its cries
no longer disturbed the serenity of the ca&ntilde;on. It slept
and ate most of the time, but kindly consented to keep
awake in the late afternoon and be gentle and patient
when the men charily passed it from hand to hand
during the rest before supper. Fletcher regarded it
tolerantly as an object of amusement. But Moreau,
especially since the feeding episode, had developed a
deep, delighted affection for it. Its helplessness appealed
to all that was tender in him, and the first faint
indications of a tiny formed character were miraculous
to his fascinated and wondering observation. He
was secretly ashamed of letting the sneeringly indifferent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Fletcher guess his sudden attachment, and made
foolish excuses to account for the trips to the cabin
which frequently interrupted his morning&#8217;s work in
the stream bed.</p>

<p>Lucy&#8217;s recovery was slow. The collapse from which
she suffered was as much mental as physical. The
anguish of the last two years had preyed on the
bruised spirit as the hardships of the journey had
broken the feeble body. No particular form of ailment
developed in her, but she lay for days silent and almost
motionless on the bunk, too feeble to move or to
speak beyond short sentences. The men watched and
tended her, Moreau with clumsy solicitude, Fletcher
dutifully, but more through fear of his powerful mate
than especial interest in Lucy as a woman or a human
being.</p>

<p>In his heart he still violently resented Moreau&#8217;s
action in acquiring her and parting with the valuable
horses. Had she possessed any of the attractions of
the human female, he could have understood and
probably condoned. But as she now was, plain, helpless,
sick, unable even to cook for them, demanding
care which took from their work and lessened their
profits, his resentment grew instead of diminishing.
Moreau saw nothing of this, for Fletcher had long ago
read the simple secrets of that generous but impractical
nature, and knew too much to bring down on
himself wrath which, once aroused, he felt would be
implacable.</p>

<p>At the end of two weeks Lucy began to show signs
of improvement. The fragrant air that blew through
the cabin, the soothing silence of the foothills, broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
only by the drowsy prattle of the river or the sad murmuring
of the great pine, began its work of healing.
The autumn was late that year. The days were still
warm and dreamily brilliant, especially in the little
ca&ntilde;on, where the sun drew the aromatic odors from
the pines till at midday they exhaled a heavy, pungent
fragrance like incense rising to the worship of some
sylvan god.</p>

<p>Sometimes now, on warm afternoons, Lucy crept
out and sat at the root of the pine where she had found
her first place of refuge. There her dulled eyes began
to note the beauties that surrounded her, the pines
mounting in dark rows on the slopes, the blue distances
where the ca&ntilde;on folded on itself, the glimpses
of chaste, white summits far above against the blue.
Her lungs breathed deep of the revivifying air, clean
and untainted as the water in the little spring at her
feet. The peace of it all entered her soul. Something
in her forbade her to look back on the terrible
past. A new life was here, and her youth rose up and
whispered that it was not yet dead.</p>

<p>During the period of her illness Moreau had begun
to see both himself and the cabin through feminine
eyes. Discrepancies revealed themselves. He wanted
many things heretofore regarded as luxuries. From
the tin cups of the table service to the towels made of
ripped flour sacks, his domestic arrangements seemed
mean and inadequate. They were all right for two
prospectors, but not fitting for a woman and child.
Lucy&#8217;s illness also revealed wants in her equipment
that struck him as piteous. Her only boots were the
ones he had seen her in on the morning after her arrival.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
She had no shawl or covering for cold weather.
The baby&#8217;s clothes were a few torn pieces of calico
and flannel. Moreau had washed these many times
himself, doing them up in an old flour sack, which was
attached to an aspen on the stream&#8217;s bank, and then
placed in one of the deepest parts of the current.
Here it remained for two days, the percolating water
cleansing its contents as no washboard could.</p>

<p>One evening, smoking under the pine, he acquainted
Fletcher with a design he had been some days formulating.
This was that Fletcher should ride into Hangtown
the next day and not only replenish the commissariat,
but buy all things needful for Lucy and the
baby. Spotty was now also recovered, and, though
hardly a mettlesome steed, was at least a useful pack
horse. But the numerous list of articles suggested
by Moreau would have weighted Spotty to the ground.
So Fletcher was commissioned to buy a pack burro,
and upon it to bring all needful food stuffs for the
cabin and the habiliments for Lucy and the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got no shoes. You want to buy her some
shoes, one useful pair and one fancy pair with heels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What size do I git? I ain&#8217;t never bought shoes for
a woman before.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a poser, and both men cogitated till
Moreau suggested leaving it to the shoe dealer, who
should be told that Lucy was a woman of average size.</p>

<p>&#8220;But her feet ain&#8217;t,&#8221; said Fletcher spitefully, never
having been able to forgive Lucy her lack of beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind; you&#8217;ll have to make a bluff at it. Get
the best you can. Then I want a shawl for her. It&#8217;ll
be cold soon, and she&#8217;s got nothing to keep her warm.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;What kind of a shawl? I don&#8217;t know no more
about shawls than I do about shoes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pink crochet shawl,&#8221; said Moreau slowly, and
with evident sheepish reluctance at having to make
this exhibition of unexpected knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s that? I dunno what crochet is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, either&#8221;&mdash;and then, with desperate courage&mdash;&#8220;well,
anyway, that&#8217;s what she said she&#8217;d like. I
asked her yesterday and she said that. You go into the
store and ask for it. That&#8217;ll be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then I want some toys for the kid. Anything
you can get that seems the right kind. She&#8217;s a
girl, so you don&#8217;t want a drum, or soldiers, or guns,
or things of that kind. Get a doll if you can, and a
musical box, or anything tasty and that&#8217;s likely to
catch a baby&#8217;s eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, she can&#8217;t hardly see yet. She&#8217;s like a blind
kitten. Lucy told me herself yesterday she were only
six weeks old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind. She&#8217;s a smart kid; knows more
now than most babies at six months. You might get a
rattle&mdash;a nice one with bells; she might fancy that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silver or gold?&#8221; sneered Fletcher, whom this conversation
was making meditative.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best you can get. Don&#8217;t stint yourself for
money; everything of the best. Then clothes for her;
she is going to be as well dressed as any baby in California.
I take it you&#8217;d better go to Mrs. Wingate, at
the Eldorado Hotel, and get her to make you out a
list; then go to the store and buy the list right down.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;Seems to me you&#8217;ll want a pack train, not a burro,
to carry it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you can&#8217;t get everything on Spotty and one
burro, buy two. I&#8217;ll give you a sack of dust and you
can spend it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher was silent after this, and as he lay rolled
in his blanket that night he looked at the stars for
many hours, thinking.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he departed on the now brisk
and rejuvenated Spotty. Besides his instructions he
carried one of Moreau&#8217;s buckskin sacks, roughly estimated
to contain twelve hundred dollars&#8217; worth of
dust, and, he told Moreau, one of his own. He was
due to return the next morning. With a short word of
farewell, he touched Spotty with the single Mexican
spur he wore, and darted away down the rough trail.
Moreau watched him out of sight.</p>

<p>The day passed as quietly as its predecessors. The
main events that marked their course had been the
men&#8217;s clean-up, Lucy&#8217;s gain in strength and the evidences
of increasing intelligence in the child.</p>

<p>To-day Lucy had walked to a point a little distance
up the ca&ntilde;on, rested there, and in the afternoon came
creeping back with the flush of returning health on her
face. It was still there when Moreau ascended from
the stream bed with his cup. He had had a good day&#8217;s
work and was joyful, showing the fine yellow grains in
the bottom of the rusty tin. Then he noticed her improved
appearance and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you look blooming. A fellow&#8217;d think you&#8217;d
panned a good day&#8217;s work, too.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>To himself he said with a sudden inward wonder:</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks almost pretty. And she <i>is</i> only nineteen,
I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning he awaited the coming of Fletcher
with impatience. He had wanted to surprise Lucy,
having only told her Fletcher had gone to buy a burro
and some supplies. But the morning passed away and
he had not returned. Then the afternoon slipped by,
and Lucy and Moreau took their supper without him,
the latter rather taciturn. The delay wore on his
patience. His knowledge of Fletcher was limited.
He had seen him drunk once in Sacramento, and he
wondered if he had gone on a spree and was now lying
senseless somewhere, the contents of the sacks squandered.</p>

<p>When the next morning had passed and Fletcher
had still not come, his suspicions strengthened and he
began to think uneasily of his dust. One sack full was
a good deal to lose, now that he had a woman and
child on his hands. Lucy, he could see, was also uneasy.
Twice he surprised her standing by the trail,
evidently listening. When evening drew in and there
were still no signs of him, both were frankly anxious
and oppressed. Suddenly, as they sat by the box that
answered as dinner table, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he have much dust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;one sack of mine and one of his own.
They&#8217;re equal to about twelve hundred dollars each.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a startled look at him and sat with her
mouth a little open, fear and amaze on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the rest?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Moreau indicated the box under the bunk. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
same moment her suspicion seized him and he pulled
it out and threw up the lid. It was empty of all save
a few clothes. Every sack was gone.</p>

<p>Moreau shut down the lid quietly, a little pale. He
was not a man of quick mind, and he hardly could
realize what had happened. It was Lucy&#8217;s voice that
explained it as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He did it while I was out in the morning. I went
up the stream to that pool to wash some things at sun-up.
He took it then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fletcher had gone silently and without leaving a
trace, and with him the money. It was a startling
situation for Moreau. From comparative affluence he
suddenly found himself without a cent or an ounce of
dust. This, had he had only himself to look after,
would not have affected his free and jovial spirit, but
now the woman and the child he had so carelessly
come into possession of loomed before him in their true
light of a heavy responsibility. Lucy, as far as supporting
herself went, was still a long way off from the
state of health where that would be possible. And at
the thought of sending her forth, even though she were
cured of her infirmities, Moreau experienced a sensation
of depression. He felt that the cabin would be
unbearably lonely when she and the baby were gone.</p>

<p>That night under the pine he turned over the situation
in his mind. The conclusion he arrived at was
that there was nothing better to be done than stay by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the stream bed and work it for all it was worth. Lucy
would continue to improve in the fine air and the child
was thriving. If the snows would hold off till late, as
they had done in the open winter of &#8217;50, he could amass
a fair share of dust before it would be necessary to
move Lucy and the baby to the superior accommodations
of Hangtown or Sacramento. It was now October.
In November one might expect the first snows.</p>

<p>He must do a good deal in the next six weeks. This
he started to do. The next day he spent in raising a
brush shed against the back of the cabin where the
chimney would offer warmth on cold nights. Into
this he moved such few belongings as he had retained
after Lucy and the baby had taken possession of the
cabin. Then the working of the stream bed went on
with renewed vigor. The water was low, hardly more
than a thread, rendering the washing of the dirt harder
labor than during the earlier summer when the watercourses
were still full. But he toiled mightily, rejoicing
in the splendor of his man&#8217;s work, not with
the same knightly freedom that he felt when he had
been that king of men, the miner with his pick on his
shoulder and all the world before him, but with the
soberer joy of the man into whose life others have
entered to lay hold upon it with light, clinging hands.</p>

<p>Against the complete and perfect loneliness of his
life the woman and child, who had started up from
nowhere, stood out as figures of vital significance.
They had grown closer to him in that one month&#8217;s
isolation than they would have done in a year of city
life. The child became the object of his secret but
deep devotion. He had been ashamed to let Fletcher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
see it. Now that Fletcher was gone, Moreau often stole
up from his work in the creek to look at it as it slept in
a box by the open door. It was as fresh as a rosebud,
its skin clean and satiny, its tiny hands, crumpled, white
and pink, like the petals of flowers. The big man
leaned on his shovel to watch it adoringly. The
miracle of its growth in beauty never lost its wonder
for him.</p>

<p>Lucy, too, grew and bloomed in these quiet autumn
days. Never talkative, she became less laconic after
the departure of Fletcher. She seemed relieved by
his absence. Moreau began to understand, as he saw
her daily increase in freshness and youthful charm,
that she was as young in nature as she was in years.
Points of character that were touchingly childish appeared
in her. Her casting of all responsibility on
him was as absolute as if she had been ten years of
age. She obeyed him with trustful obedience and
waited on him silently, her eyes always on him to try
to read his unexpressed wish. Sometimes he caught
these watching eyes and read in them something that
vaguely disturbed him.</p>

<p>One day, coming up from the creek for one of his
surreptitious views of the baby, he found its cradle
empty, and was about to return to his work, when
he heard a laugh rising from a small knoll among the
aspens. It was a laugh of the most infectious, fresh
sweetness, and made Moreau&#8217;s own lips part. He
stole in its direction, and as he advanced it sounded
again, rippling deliciously on the crystal air. He
brushed through the aspens and came on Lucy and her
baby. She was holding it in her lap, one hand on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
back of its head. Something had touched its unknown
sense of the ludicrous, and its lips were parting in a
slow but intensely amused smile over its toothless
gums. Each smile was answered by its mother with a
run of the laughter Moreau had heard.</p>

<p>He looked at them for a moment, and then, advancing,
his foot cracked a dry branch, and Lucy turned.
Her face was flushed, her eyes still full of their past
merriment, her smiling lips looked a coral red against
the whiteness of her small, even teeth. Her sunbonnet
was off and her rich hair glowed like copper in
the sun. He had never seen her look like this, and
stopped, regarding her with a curious, sudden gravity.
The thought was in his heart:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s only a girl, and&mdash;and&mdash;almost beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy looked confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just laughing at the baby,&#8221; she said
apologetically; &#8220;she looked so sorter cute smiling that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard you laugh like that before. Why
don&#8217;t you do it oftener?&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed embarrassed and murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d like to hear me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re sometimes afraid of me,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;is that true?&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent her face over the baby and said very low:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid as how you might get mad at me. I
don&#8217;t know much and&mdash;I&#8217;m different, and you&#8217;ve been
more good to me than&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, her face hidden over the child. Moreau
felt a sudden sense of embarrassed discomfort.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t talk that way,&#8221; he said, hastily, &#8220;or I
may get mad. That&#8217;s the sort of talk that annoys me.
Laugh and be happy&mdash;that&#8217;s the way I want you to be.
Enjoy yourself; that&#8217;s the way to please me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung himself down from the knoll into the
creek bed and went back to his rocker. He found
it hard to collect his thoughts. The music of Lucy&#8217;s
laugh haunted him.</p>

<p>A week, and then two, passed away. The golden
days slipped by, still warm, still scented with the healing
pine balsam. The nights were white with great
stars, which Moreau could see between the pine
boughs, for it was still warm enough to sleep on the
knoll. His nights&#8217; rests were now often disturbed. A
change had come over the situation in the cabin. The
peace and serenity of the first days after Fletcher&#8217;s departure
had gone, leaving a sense of constraint and
uneasiness in their stead. Moreau now looked up at
the stars not with the calm content of the days when
Lucy had first come, but with the trouble of a man
who begins to realize menace in what he thought were
harmless things.</p>

<p>Nearly a month had passed since Fletcher&#8217;s departure
when one day, walking down the stream with
an idea of trying diggings farther down, he came upon
Lucy washing in a pool of water enlarged by a rough
dam she herself had constructed. She was kneeling
on a flat stone on the bank, her sunbonnet off, her
sleeves rolled up, laving in the water the few articles
of dress that made up the baby&#8217;s wardrobe. Her arms
above the sunburned wrists shone snow-white, her
roughened hair lay low on her forehead in damp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
curly strands. The sight of her engaged in this
menial toil irritated Moreau and he called:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing there, Lucy? Get up.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started with one of her old nervous movements
and sat back on the stone. Then, seeing who it was,
smiled confidently, and brushed the hair back from
her forehead with one wet hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was washing the baby&#8217;s things. That&#8217;s the dam
I made.&#8221;</p>

<p>Moreau stood looking, not at the dam, but at the
woman, flushed, breathless and smiling, a blooming
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one would ever think you were the same woman
who came here two months ago,&#8221; he said, more to
himself than to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like the same,&#8221; she answered, beginning
to wring her clothes. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel now as if
that was me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were quite an old woman then. Do
you know that? I&#8217;d no idea you were young.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt old. Oh, God&mdash;!&#8221; she said, suddenly dropping
her hands and looking across the pool with darkly
reminiscent eyes&mdash;&#8220;how awful I felt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re quite well now? You&#8217;re really well,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; she said, returning to her tone
of gaiety. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t never been like this before. Not
sence I was married, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The allusion to her marriage made Moreau wince.
Of late the subject had become hateful to him. Standing,
leaning on his shovel, he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;You know it&#8217;ll be winter here soon, so it&#8217;s a good
thing we&#8217;ve got you well and nicely rested up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess &#8217;twill be winter soon,&#8221; she said, looking
vaguely round; &#8220;does it snow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes tons of it, if it&#8217;s a hard winter. But
we&#8217;ve got to get out before that. Or you have, anyhow.
Can&#8217;t run any risks with the baby. Got to get
her out and into some decent shelter before the snow
falls.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Lucy made no answer. She had
stopped wringing the clothes and was kneeling on the
stone, her eyes on the water, a faint line drawn between
her brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to&mdash;? What sort o&#8217; place?&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>Moreau shifted his eyes from her face to the earth
in which the point of his shovel had imbedded itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you as soon as you got well I&#8217;d take you to
Hangtown or Sacramento, or even &#8217;Frisco if they
didn&#8217;t suit. Now I haven&#8217;t got dust enough to do
that. Fletcher put that spoke in my wheel. But I&#8217;ll
take you and the baby into Hangtown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hangtown?&#8221; she repeated faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s quite a ways off. I&#8217;ll have to go in myself
and get a horse first, and then I&#8217;ll take you both
in on that. I thought I&#8217;d go to Mrs. Wingate. Her
husband runs the Eldorado Hotel, and she isn&#8217;t strong,
and told me last time I was there she&#8217;d give a fancy
salary if she could get a housekeeper. How&#8217;d you like
to try that? It would be a first-class home for you
and the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy had bent her face over the wet clothes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it all right here?&#8221; she said in a scarcely
audible voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Moreau irritably; &#8220;I just told you there
was danger of being snowed in after the first of November.
You don&#8217;t want to be snowed in here with
the baby, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t feel strong enough to do work like
that,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you can stay on in the hotel. I
can make the dust for that easily. Then in the spring,
when the streams are full, I&#8217;ll have enough to send
you to Sacramento or San Francisco, and you can
look about you and see how you&#8217;d like it there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I stay here?&#8221; she said suddenly, her
voice quavering, but full of protest.</p>

<p>Its note thrilled Moreau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just told you why,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not afraid. I don&#8217;t mind snow. You
can get things to eat from Hangtown. Oh, let me
stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned toward him, still kneeling on the stone.
Her face was quivering with the most violent emotions
he had ever seen on it. The dead apathy was gone
forever, at least as far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let me stay,&#8221; she implored; &#8220;don&#8217;t send me
away from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lucy,&#8221; he almost groaned, &#8220;don&#8217;t you see that
won&#8217;t do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me stay,&#8221; she reiterated, and stretched out her
hands toward him. The tears began to pour down
her cheeks, and suddenly with the outstretched hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
she seized him, and burst forth into a stream of impassioned
words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me stay. Let me be with you. Don&#8217;t send
me away. There ain&#8217;t no use in anything if I&#8217;m not
with you. Let me work for you. Let me be where
I can see you&mdash;that&#8217;s all I want. I don&#8217;t want no
money nor clothes. If you&#8217;ll just let me be near by!
And I kin always work and cook, and you know you
like things clean, and I kin keep &#8217;em clean. Oh, you
can&#8217;t mean to send me off. I ain&#8217;t never been happy
before. I ain&#8217;t never had no one treat me so kind
before. I ain&#8217;t never known what it was like to be
treated decent. I can&#8217;t leave you&mdash;I can&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank down at his feet in a quivering heap.</p>

<p>Moreau raised her and held her in his arms, pressed
against his breast, his cheek against her hair. He had
no thought for the moment but an ecstasy of pity and
joy. Clinging close to him, she reiterated between
broken breaths:</p>

<p>&#8220;I kin stay? Oh! I kin stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how can you? Do you know what
you&#8217;re asking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I kin stay?&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>She slid one arm round his neck, and he felt her
wet cheek against his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me just stay and work,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;just
where I can see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you forget that you&#8217;re married?&#8221; he said
huskily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not be in your way. I&#8217;ll not ask for anything
or be any trouble,&#8221; was her whispered answer, &#8220;so
long&#8217;s you let me be near you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>They walked back to the cabin silently. Lucy knew
that she had gained her point and would stay. Her
childish nature invaded and possessed by a great passion
built on gratitude and reverence, asked no more
than to be allowed to work for and worship the man
who was to her a god. She did not look into the
future, nor demand its secrets. The perfect joy of the
present filled her. In the days that followed she grew
in beauty, and in some subtile way acquired a new girlishness.
Her past seemed wiped out. The blighting
effects of the four previous years fell away from her
and she seemed to revert to the sweet and simple
youthfulness that had been hers when Jake Shackleton
had married her at St. Louis. Silent and gentle
as ever, it was plain to be seen that whatever Moreau
asked for&mdash;service, friendship, love&mdash;she would unquestioningly
give.</p>

<p>Early in November a cold evening came with a red
sunset and a sharpening of every outline. For the
first time they were driven into the cabin for supper.
A fire of boughs and dried cones burned in the chimney
and before this, supper being over, they sat, Lucy
in the rocker made of a barrel, Moreau on the end of
an upturned box, staring at the flames.</p>

<p>Finally the man broke the silence by telling her that
he was going to take his dust and walk into Hangtown
the next day, remaining there over night and returning
in the morning with fresh supplies and a burro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; he said, drawing his box nearer to her, &#8220;I
want to talk to you of something.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up, saw that the moment both had been
dreading had come, and paled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;Lucy, the winter&#8217;s coming. The snow may be here
now at any moment. Have you thought of what
we&#8217;re to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head and began to tremble. His
words called up the specter of separation&mdash;what she
feared most in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know we can&#8217;t live on this way. Will you, if
I go into Hangtown and bring back a mule, ride there
with me the day after to-morrow and marry me?
There are two or three preachers there who will do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with surprised eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m married already to Jake,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How kin
I get married again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, and it&#8217;s no good trying to break that
marriage. But in your eyes and mine that was none.
You and your baby are mine to take care of and support
and love for the rest of our lives. Though you
can&#8217;t be my lawful wife, I can protect you from scandal
and insult by making you what all the world will
think is my lawful wife. Only you, and I and Jake
and his second wife will know that there has been a
previous marriage and not one of that four will ever
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her rough hand out and felt his great fist
close over it, like a symbol of the protection he was
offering her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can be married in Hangtown by your maiden
name. If any one asks I can say I am marrying a
young widow whose husband died on the Sierra. Your
husband <i>did</i> die there when he sold you to me for a
pair of horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, not quite understanding his meaning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;Kin Jake ever come and claim me?&#8221; she asked in a
frightened voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could he? How could he dare tell the world
how he left you and his child sick, almost dying, in
the hut of an unknown miner in the foothills? This
is California, where men don&#8217;t forgive that sort of
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent, and then said: &#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s go to
Hangtown and be married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was your first marriage perfectly legal? Have
you got the marriage certificate?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, dragged out the bundle she had brought
with her, and from it drew a long dirty envelope which
she handed to him.</p>

<p>He opened it and found the certificate. It was accurate
in every detail. His eye ran over the ages and
names of the contracting parties&mdash;Lucy Fraser, fifteen,
to Jacob Shackleton, twenty-four, at St. Louis.</p>

<p>Twisting the paper in his hands he sat moodily eying
the fire. The second marriage was the only way
he could think of by which he could lend a semblance
of right to the impossible position in which his generous
action had placed him. Divorce, in that remote locality
and at that early day of laws, half administered
and chaotic, was impossible, and even had it been easily
obtained he shrank from dragging into publicity the
piteous story of how the woman he loved had been
sold to him.</p>

<p>That a marriage with Jake Shackleton&#8217;s wife was a
legal offense he knew, but with one of those strange
whimsies of character which mark mankind, he felt
that the reading of the marriage service over Lucy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and himself would in some way sanctify what could
never be a lawful tie.</p>

<p>In a spasm of rage and disgust he held out the
paper to the flames, when Lucy, with a smothered
cry sprang forward and seized it. It was the first
violent action into which he had ever seen her betrayed.
He looked in surprise into her flushed and alarmed
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Why not destroy everything that could
connect you with such a past?&#8221; he said, almost angrily.</p>

<p>She hesitated, smoothing out the paper with trembling
hands. Then she said falteringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;he was her father,&#8221; indicating
the sleeping baby. &#8220;I was married to him all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He understood the instinct that made her wish to
keep the paper as a record of her child&#8217;s legitimacy,
and made no further comment.</p>

<p>The next morning at dawn he started for his long
walk into Hangtown, taking with him all the dust he
had accumulated since Fletcher&#8217;s departure. He was
absent till the afternoon of the following day, when
he reappeared leading a small pack-mule, laden with
supplies, among which were several articles of dress
for Lucy and the baby, so that they might make a fitting
appearance when they rode into camp for the
wedding. Lucy was overjoyed at her finery, and arrayed
in it looked so pretty and so girlish that Moreau,
for the first time since the scene by the creek, took
her in his arms and kissed her. It was the kiss of the
bridegroom and the master.</p>

<p>The next morning when she woke the cabin was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
curiously dark. Going to the door to open it, she found
it resisted, and went to the window. The world was
wrapped in a blinding fall of snow. When Moreau
came in for breakfast, he reported a blizzard outside.
The cold was intense, the wind high, and the snow
so fine and so torn by the gale that it was like a mist
of whiteness enveloping the cabin. Already it was
piled high about the walls and had to be shoveled from
the door to permit of its opening. Fortunately they
had collected a large amount of fire wood which was
piled in the brush shed in which the man lived. During
the morning Moreau took the animals from their shelter
and stabled them in his. There was fodder for them
and a bed of leaves, and the heat of the chimney
warmed the fragile hut.</p>

<p>All day the storm raged, and in the evening, as he
and Lucy sat before the fire, they could hear the turmoil
of the tempest outside, moaning through the
ranks of the sentinel pines. They were silent, listening
to this shouting of the unloosed elements, and feeling
an indescribably sweet sense of home and shelter in
their rugged cabin and each other&#8217;s society.</p>

<p>The storm was one of those unexpected blizzards
which sometimes visit the Sierras in the early winter.
With brief intervals of sunshine, the snow fell off and
on for nearly a month. Moreau had to exercise almost
superhuman effort to keep the cabin from being buried,
and, as it was, the drifts nearly covered the window. It
was impossible to travel any distance, as the snow was
of a fine, feathery texture which did not pack tight, and
into which the wanderer sank to the arm-pits. Fortunately
the last trip into Hangtown had stocked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
cabin well with provisions. No cares menaced its inmates,
who, warm and happy in the vast snow-buried
solitudes of the mountains, led an enchanted existence,
forgetting and forgotten by the world.</p>

<p>When the storm ended the miner attempted to get
into the settlements with the mule. But the beast, exhausted
by the insufficient food, as the best part of the
fodder had to be given to the cow, fell by the way,
dying in one of the drifts. This seemed to sever their
last link with the world. Nature had drawn an unbroken
circle of loneliness around them. Under its
spell they were drawn closer together till their lives
merged&mdash;the primitive man and woman living for and
by love in the primitive wilderness.</p>

<p>So the enchanted winter passed. The man, at intervals,
making his way into the settlements for food and
the few articles of clothing that they needed. It was
a terrible winter, nearly as fierce as that of &#8217;46, but between
the storms Moreau fitfully worked the stream,
obtaining enough dust to pay for their provisions. The
outside world seemed to fade from their lives, which
were bounded by the walls of the cabin. Here, in
the long fire-lit evenings, Moreau read to Lucy, taught
her from his few books, strove to develop the mind
that misfortune had almost crushed. She responded
to his teachings with the quickness of love. Without
much mental ability she improved because she
lived only for what he desired. She smoothed the
roughness of her speech and studied to correct her
grammatical errors. She made him set her little tasks
such as a child studies, and in the evenings he watched
her with surreptitious amusement, as she conned over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her spelling, or traced letters in her copy-book. She
was passionately desirous of being worthy of him, and
of leaving her old chrysalis behind her when she issued
from the cabin.</p>

<p>This was not to be until the early spring. It was
nearly six months from the time the emigrant wagon
had stopped at his door, that Moreau, having accumulated
enough dust to buy another mule and another outfit&mdash;took
Lucy and the child into Hangtown for the
marriage. This ceremony, about which in the beginning
she had been somewhat apathetic, she now earnestly
desired. It was accomplished without publicity
or difficulty, Lucy assuming her maiden name of Fraser,
and passing as a young widow. In the afternoon
they started back for the cabin, Moreau on foot, with
his wife and baby on the mule. They had decided to
stay by their claim during the spring and early summer
when the streams were high.</p>

<p>Thus the spring passed and the summer came. During
this season Lucy, for the first time, saw that most
lovely of Californian wild-flowers, the mariposa lily,
and called her baby after it. As time went on and no
other child was born, Moreau came to regard the little
Mariposa as more and more his own. His affection for
her became a paternal passion. It was decided between
himself and Lucy that she should never know the secret
of her parentage, but be called by his name and be
brought up as his child. As the happiness of the union
grew in depth and strength both the man and woman
desired more ardently to forget beyond all recall the
terrible past from which she had entered his life. It
grew to be a subject to which Moreau could bear no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
allusion, and their life was purposely quiet and secluded,
for fear of a chance encounter with some disturbing
reminder.</p>

<p>So the time passed. In the course of the next few
years Moreau moved from the smaller camps into Sacramento.
Though a man of little commercial ability,
he was always able, in those halcyon days, to make a
good living for the woman and child to whom he had
given his life. Years of prosperity made it possible to
give to Mariposa every educational advantage the
period and town offered. The child showed musical
talent, and for the development of this he was keenly
ambitious.</p>

<p>Across their tranquil life, now and then, came a lurid
gleam from the career of the man who was Lucy Moreau&#8217;s
lawful husband. Jake Shackleton was soon a
marked figure in the new state. But his rise to sensational
fortune began with the booming days of the
Comstock. Then his star rose blazing above the horizon.
He was one of the original exploiters of the
great lode and was one of those who owned that solid
cone of silver which has gone down to history as the
Reydel Monte. Ten years from his entrance into the
state he was a rich man. In twenty, he was one of that
group of millionaires, whose names were sounded from
end to end of an astonished country.</p>

<p>A quarter of a century from the time when he had
crossed the desert in an emigrant wagon, with his two
wives, he read in the paper he had recently bought as
an occupation and investment, a notice of the death of
Daniel Moreau in Santa Barbara. It was brief, as befitted
a pioneer who had sunk so completely out of sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and memory, leaving neither vast wealth nor picturesque
record. The paragraph stated that &#8220;the
pioneer&#8217;s devoted wife and daughter attended his last
hours, which were tranquil and free from pain. It is
understood that the deceased leaves but little fortune,
having during the last two or three years been incapacitated
for work by enfeebled health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Four months after the death of Dan Moreau his
adopted daughter, Mariposa, sat at the piano, in a
small cottage on Pine Street, in San Francisco, singing.
Her performance was less melodious than remarkable,
for she was engaged in &#8220;trying her voice.&#8221;
This was Mariposa&#8217;s greatest claim to distinction, and,
she hoped, to fortune. With it she dreamed of conquering
fame and bringing riches to her mother and
herself.</p>

<p>She was so far from either of these goals that she
permitted herself to speculate on them as one does on
impossible glories. The merits of her voice were as
unknown in San Francisco as she was. Its cultivation
had been a short and exciting episode, relinquished for
lack of means. Now it was not only given up, but
Mariposa was teaching piano herself, and was feverishly
exalted when, the week before, her three pupils
had been augmented by a fourth. Four pupils, at fifty
cents a lesson, brought in four dollars a week&mdash;sixteen
a month.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I make sixteen dollars a week after four months&#8217;
work,&#8221; Mariposa had said to her mother, on the acquisition
of this fourth pupil, &#8220;then in one year I ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
make thirty-two dollars a month. Don&#8217;t you think
that&#8217;s a reasonable way of reckoning?&#8221;</p>

<p>From which it will be seen that Mariposa was not
only young in years, but a novice at the work of wage-earning.</p>

<p>She was in reality twenty-five years of age, but
passed as, and believed herself to be, twenty-four. She
had developed into one of those lordly women, stately
of carriage, wide of shoulder and deep of breast, that
California grows so triumphantly. She had her
mother&#8217;s thick, red-brown hair, with its flat loose ripple
and the dog&#8217;s brown eyes to match, a skin as white as a
blanched almond with a slight powdering of freckles
over her nose, and lips that were freshly red and delicately
defined against the warm pallor surrounding
them. She was, in fact, a beautified likeness of the Lucy
that Moreau saw come gropingly back to youth and desirableness
in the cabin on the flank of the Sierra.
Only happiness and refinement and a youth passed in
an atmosphere of love, had given her all that richness
of girlhood, that effervescent confidence and joy of
youth that poor Lucy had never known.</p>

<p>Despite her air of a young princess, her proudly-held
head, her almost Spanish dignity, where only her
brown eyes looked full of alertness and laughter, she
was in character and knowledge of life foolishly young&mdash;in
reality, a little girl masquerading in the guise of a
triumphantly maturing womanhood. Her life had
been one of quietude and seclusion. Her parents had
been agreed in their desire for this; the father in the
fear of a re&euml;ncounter with some phantom from the
past. Lucy&#8217;s ostensible reason was her own delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
health; but her dread was that Shackleton might see
his child and claim her. It seemed impossible to the
adoring mother that any father could see this splendid
daughter and not rise up and call her his before all
men.</p>

<p>The afternoon was cold and Mariposa wore a jacket
as she sang. The cottage in Pine Street was all that a
cottage ought not to be,&mdash;on the wrong side of the
street, &#8220;too far out,&#8221; cold, badly built, and with only
one window to catch the western sun. It had one advantage
which went a long way with the widow and
her daughter&mdash;the rent was twenty dollars a month.
Mariposa had paid ten dollars of this with her earnings,
and kept the other six for pocket-money. But the
happy day was dawning, so she thought, when she
could pay the whole twenty. She cogitated on this and
the affluence it would indicate, as her real father might
have cogitated when he and the inner ring of his associates
began to realize that the Reydel Monte was not
a pocket, but a solid mound of mineral.</p>

<p>On this gray afternoon the cold little parlor, with its
bulge of bay window looking out on the dreariness of
the street, seemed impregnated with an air of dejection.
In common with many poor dwellings in that city of
extravagant reverses, it was full of the costly relics of
better days. San Francisco has more of such parlors
than any city in the country. The pieces of buhl and
marquetry hiding their shame in twenty-dollar cottages
and eighteen-dollar flats furnish pathetic commentary
on many a story of fallen fortunes. The furniture looks
abashed and humbled. Sometimes its rich designs have
found a grateful seclusion under the dust of a quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
century, which finally will be removed by the restoring
processes of the second-hand dealer, who will eventually
become its owner.</p>

<p>There was a beautiful marquetry sideboard in the
gray front parlor and a fine scarlet lacquer Chinese
cabinet facing it. Moreau had had the tall, gilt-framed
mirror and console brought round The Horn from
New York when he had been in the flush of good times
in Sacramento. The piano Mariposa was playing dated
from a second period of prosperity, and had cost what
would have now kept them for a year. It had been
considered cheap at the time, and had been bought
when the little Mariposa began to show musical tastes.
She had played her first &#8220;pieces&#8221; on it, and in that
halcyon period when she had had the singing lessons,
had heard the big voice in her chest slowly shaking
itself loose to the accompaniment of its encouraging
notes.</p>

<p>Now she was singing in single tones, from note to
note, higher and higher, then lower and lower. Her
voice was a mezzo, with a &#8220;break&#8221; in the middle, below
which it had a haunting, bell-like depth. As it went
down it gained a peculiar emotional quality which
seemed to thrill with passion and tears. As it began
to ascend it was noticeable that her upper tones, though
full, were harsh. There was astounding volume in
them. It was evidently a big voice, a thing of noble
promise, but now crude and unmanageable.</p>

<p>She emitted a loud vibrant note that rolled restlessly
between the four walls, as if in an effort to find more
space wherein to expand, and her hands fell upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
keys. In the room opening off the parlor there was an
uncertain play of light from an unseen fire, and a
muffled shape lying on the sofa. To this she now addressed
a query in a voice in which dejection was veiled
by uneasy inquiry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, does it seem to improve? Or is it still like a
cow when she&#8217;s lost her calf?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderfully improved,&#8221; came the answer from
the room beyond; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think any one sings like you.
Anyway, no one has such a powerful voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one howls so, you mean! Oh, mother, do you
suppose I <i>ever</i> shall be able to take any more lessons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, of course. We are in a large city now.
Even if you don&#8217;t make enough money yourself, there
are often people who become interested in fine voices
and educate them. Perhaps you&#8217;ll meet one of them
some day. And anyway&mdash;&#8221; with cheerfulness caught
on the upward breath of a sigh&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ll make money
enough soon yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s head bent over the keys. When she came
to view it this way, her sixteen dollars a month did not
seem so big with promise as it did when ten dollars for
rent was all it had to yield up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about those rich people who are looking
for prima donnas to develop, but I don&#8217;t know where
to find them, and I don&#8217;t see how they&#8217;re to find me.
The only way I can ever attract their notice is to sing
on the street corner with a guitar, like Rachel. And
then I&#8217;d have to have a license, and I&#8217;ve got no money
for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, and swept with the gait of a queen into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the next room. Her mother was lying on a sofa drawn
closely to a tiny grate, in which a handful of fire flickered.</p>

<p>Lucy was still a pretty woman, with a thin, faded
delicacy of aspect. Her skin was singularly white, especially
on her hands, which were waxen. Though
love and happiness had given her back her youth, her
health had never recovered her child&#8217;s rude birth in the
desert and the subsequent journey across the Sierra.
She had twined round and clung to the man whom she
had called her husband, and with his loss she was
slowly sinking out of the world his presence had made
sweet for her. Her daughter&mdash;next in adoration to the
hero who had succored her in her hour of extremity&mdash;had
no power to hold her. Lucy was slowly fading out
of life. The girl had no knowledge of this. Her
mother had been a semi-invalid for several years, and
her own youth was so rich in its superb vigor, that she
did not notice the elder woman&#8217;s gradual decline of
vitality. But the mother knew, and her nights were
wakeful and agonized with the thought of her child,
left alone, poor and unfriended.</p>

<p>Mariposa sat down on the end of the sofa at the invalid&#8217;s
feet and took one of her hands. She had loved
both parents deeply, but the fragile mother, so simple
and unworldly, so dependent on affection for her being,
was the object of her special devotion. They were silent,
the girl with an abstracted glance fixed on the fire,
meditating on the future of her voice; the mother regarding
her with pensive admiration.</p>

<p>As they sat thus, a footfall on the steps outside
broke upon their thoughts. The cottage was so built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
that one of its conveniences was, that one could always
hear the caller or the man with the bill mounting the
steps before he rang. The former were rarer than the
latter, and Mariposa, in whose eventless life a visit from
any one was a thing of value, pricked up her ears expectantly.</p>

<p>The bell pealed stridently and the servant could be
heard rattling pans in the kitchen, evidently preparatory
to emerging. Presently she came creaking down
the hall, the door opened and a female voice was heard
asking for the ladies. It <i>was</i> a visitor. Mariposa was
glad she had stayed in that afternoon, and with her
hand still clasping her mother&#8217;s, craned her neck
toward the door.</p>

<p>The visitor was a tall, thin woman of forty years,
her cheaply fashionable dress telling of many a wrestle
between love of personal adornment and a lean
purse. She was one of those slightly known and unquestioningly
accepted people that women, in the
friendless and unknown condition of the Moreaus, constantly
meet in the free and easy social life of western
cities.</p>

<p>She was a Mrs. Willers, long divorced from a worthless
husband, and supporting, with a desperate and
gallant courage, herself and her child, who was one of
Mariposa&#8217;s piano pupils. Her appearance gave no clue
to the real force and indomitable bravery of the woman,
who, against blows and rebuffs, had fought her way
with a smile on her lips. Her appearance and manner,
especially in this, her society pose, were against her.
The former was flashy and over-dressed, the latter loud-voiced
and effusive. A large hat, flaunting with funeral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
plumes, was set jauntily on one side of her head,
and a spotted veil was drawn over a complexion that
was carelessly made up. Her corsets were so long and
so tight that she could hardly bend, and when she did
they emitted protesting creaks. No one would have
thought from her flamboyantly stylish get-up that she
was a reporter and &#8220;special&#8221; writer on Jake Shackleton&#8217;s
newly-acquired paper, <i>The Morning Trumpet</i>!
But in reality she was an energetic and able journalist.
It was only when adorned with her best clothes and her
&#8220;society&#8221; manners that she affected a sort of gushing
silliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, rustling in, &#8220;here&#8217;s the lady!
How&#8217;s everybody? Just as cozy and cute as a doll&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed Mrs. Moreau&#8217;s hand and then sent an
eagle glance&mdash;the glance of the reporter that is trained
to take in every salient object in one sweep&mdash;about the
room. She could have written a good description of it
from that moment&#8217;s survey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better? Of course you&#8217;re better,&#8221; she interrupted
Lucy, who had been speaking of improved health.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t San Francisco cure everybody? And daughter
there?&#8221; her bright tired eye rested on Mariposa for one
inspecting moment. &#8220;She looks nice enough to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa&#8217;s always well,&#8221; said Lucy, pressing the
hand she still held. &#8220;She was always a prize child ever
since she was a baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers leaned back and folded her white-gloved
hands over her creaking waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know she&#8217;s the handsomest thing I&#8217;ve seen in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
coon&#8217;s age,&#8221; she said, nodding her head at Mariposa.
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a girl in society that compares to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy smiled indulgently at her daughter. Mariposa,
though embarrassed, was not displeased by these
sledge-hammer compliments. They were a novelty to
her, and she regarded Mrs. Willers&mdash;despite a few peculiarities
of style&mdash;as a woman of vast knowledge and
experience in that wonderful world of gaiety and
fashion, of which she herself knew so little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I go to most of the big balls here,&#8221; continued the
visitor. &#8220;It&#8217;s always the same thing on <i>The Trumpet</i>&mdash;&#8216;Send
up Mrs. Willers to the Cotillion Club to-night;
we don&#8217;t want any other reporter but her. If you send
up any of those other jay women we&#8217;ll turn &#8217;em down.&#8217;
So up I have to hop. The other night at the Lorley&#8217;s
big blow-out, when Genevieve Lorley had her d&eacute;but, it
was the same old war-cry&mdash;&#8216;We want Mrs. Willers to-night
to do the Society, and don&#8217;t try and work off any
incompetents on us. Send her up early so&#8217;s Mrs. Lorley
can give her the dresses herself.&#8217; So up I went, and
was in the dressing-room for an hour and saw &#8217;em all,
black and white and brown, heiresses and beggars, and
not one of &#8217;em, Mrs. Moreau, to touch daughter here&mdash;not
one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;But there are so many beautiful girls in San Francisco.
Mariposa has seen them on the cars and down
town. She often tells me of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauties&mdash;yes, lots of &#8217;em; dead loads of &#8217;em. But
there&#8217;s a lot that get their beauty out of boxes and bottles.
There&#8217;s a lot&mdash;I don&#8217;t say who, I&#8217;m not one to
mention names&mdash;but there&#8217;s a lot that when they go to
bed the beauty all comes off and lies in layers on the
floor. Not that I blame them&mdash;make yourself as good-looking
as you can, that&#8217;s my motto. It&#8217;s every woman&#8217;s
duty. But you don&#8217;t want to begin so young. I
rouge myself,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, with the careless
truthfulness of one whose reputation is beyond attack,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t like it in a young girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the prettiest girl at the ball?&#8221; said Mariposa,
deeply interested. She had the curiosity of seventeen
on such subjects&mdash;subjects of which her girlhood
had been unusually barren.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I&#8217;ll tell you all that later&mdash;talk for an hour
if you can stand it. But that&#8217;s not what I came to say
to-day. It&#8217;s business to-day&mdash;real business, and I don&#8217;t
know but what all your future hangs on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a triumphant look at the startled mother
and daughter. With the introduction of serious matter
her worn face took on a certain sharp intelligence
and her language grew more masculine and less slovenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this,&#8221; she said, leaning forward impressively:
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I haven&#8217;t found Mariposa&#8217;s backer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Backer,&#8221; said Lucy, faintly, finding the word objectionable.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The person who&#8217;s to hear her sing and offer to educate
the finest voice he&#8217;s likely to hear in the next ten
years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa gave a suppressed exclamation and looked
at her mother. Lucy had paled. She was trembling at
what she felt she was to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Jake Shackleton,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, proudly
launching her bombshell.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;Jake Shackleton,&#8221; breathed Mariposa, to whom the
name meant only vaguely fabulous wealth. &#8220;The Bonanza
Man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy was sitting up, deadly pale, but she said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bonanza Man,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers. &#8220;My chief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does he know of me?&#8221; said Mariposa.
&#8220;He&#8217;s never even heard of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re off, my dear. Jake Shackleton&#8217;s
heard of everybody. He has every one ticketed
and put away in some little cell in his brain. He never
forgets a face. Some people say that&#8217;s one of the secrets
of his success; that, and the way he knows the
man or woman who&#8217;s going to get on and the one
who&#8217;s going to fall out of the procession and quit at
the first obstacle. He&#8217;s got no use for those people.
Get up and hustle, or get out&mdash;that&#8217;s his motto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But about me?&#8221; Mariposa entreated. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a queer story, anyhow. The other morning
I was sent for to the sanctum. There was a little
talk about work and then he says to me, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you
tell me your daughter was taking piano lessons, Mrs.
Willers?&#8217; Never forgets a word you say. I told him
yes; and he says: &#8216;Isn&#8217;t her teacher that Miss Moreau,
whose father died a few months ago in Santa Barbara?&#8217;
I told him yes again, and then he wheels round on the
swivel chair, looks at me so, from under his eyebrows,
and says: &#8216;I knew her father once; a fine man!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how odd,&#8221; breathed Mariposa, quivering with
interest. &#8220;I never heard father speak of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a long time ago. He knew your father up in
the mines some time in the fifties, and he said he admired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
him considerably. Then he went on and asked
me a lot of questions about you, your circumstances,
where you lived and if you were as good-looking as
your father. He said he&#8217;d heard you were an accomplished
young lady. Then I saw my cue and I said, as
carelessly as you please, that Miss Moreau had a fine
voice and plenty of musical ability, but unfortunately
was not able to cultivate either, because her means
were small, and it was a great pity some one with
money didn&#8217;t help her. I says&mdash;just as casual as could
be&mdash;it&#8217;s a great shame to see a voice like that lying idle
for want of tuition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say then?&#8221; said Mariposa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the point I&#8217;m working up to. He
thought a while, asked a few more questions, and then
said: &#8216;I&#8217;d like to meet the young lady and hear her
sing. It goes against me to have Dan Moreau&#8217;s daughter
lack for anything. Her father&#8217;d have left a fortune
if he hadn&#8217;t been a man that thought of every one else
before himself.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was father exactly. He must have known him
well. Mother, isn&#8217;t it odd he never spoke of him?
What did you say then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Why, of course, I saw my opening and jumped
in. I said, &#8216;Well, I guess I can arrange for you to meet
Miss Moreau at my rooms. I see her twice a week
when she comes to give Edna her piano lesson. I&#8217;ll ask
her when she can come, and let you know and then
she&#8217;ll sing for you.&#8217; He was pleased, he was real
pleased, and said he&#8217;d come whenever I said. And now,
young woman,&#8221; laying a large white-gloved hand on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
Mariposa&#8217;s knee, &#8220;that ought to be the beginning of a
career for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; said Mariposa, whose cheeks were
crimson, &#8220;I never heard anything so exciting in my
life, and we were just talking about it. I&#8217;ll probably
sing like a dog baying the moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you talk that way. You&#8217;ll sing your best. And
he&#8217;s not a man that you wouldn&#8217;t like Mariposa to
meet&#8221;&mdash;turning to the pale and silent Lucy. &#8220;Whatever
other faults he&#8217;s had he&#8217;s always been a straight
man with women. There&#8217;s never been that sort of
scandal about Jake Shackleton. There&#8217;s a story you&#8217;ve
probably heard, that he was originally a Mormon. I
don&#8217;t believe much in that myself. He had, anyway,
only one wife when he entered California, and she&#8217;s
been his wife ever since, and she ain&#8217;t the kind to have
stood any nonsense of the Mormon sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy gave a sudden gasping breath and sat up. The
light of the gray afternoon was dying outside, and by
the glow of the fire her unusual pallor was not noticeable.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very good of you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Mariposa will
be glad to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll come, too?&#8221; said Mrs. Willers. &#8220;He
asked about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he say he&#8217;d ever known me?&#8221; said Lucy,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not exactly that. No, I don&#8217;t believe he said
that. But he was interested in you as the wife of the
man he&#8217;d known so long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it would be only in that way,&#8221; murmured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Lucy, sinking back. &#8220;No, I can&#8217;t come. It wouldn&#8217;t
be possible. I&#8217;m not well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, do. You know you go out on the cars
sometimes, and the Sutter Street line is only two
blocks from here. I know you&#8217;d enjoy it when you got
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dearest. No, Mrs. Willers. Don&#8217;t, please, urge
me. I am not able to meet new people. No&mdash; Oh,
please don&#8217;t talk any more about my going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something of pain and protest in her voice made
them desist. She was silent again, while Mariposa and
Mrs. Willers arranged the details of the party. This
was to be small and choice. Only one other person, a
man referred to as Essex, was to come. At the name of
Essex, Mrs. Willers shot a side look of inspection at
Mariposa, who did what was expected of her in displaying
a fine blush.</p>

<p>It was decided that Mrs. Willers&#8217; hospitality should
take the form of wine and cake. There was a consultation
about other and lesser viands, and finally an animated
discussion as to the proper garb in which Mariposa
should present herself to the first truly distinguished
person she had ever met. During the conversation
over these varied questions Lucy lay back
among her cushions, sunk in the same pale silence.</p>

<p>Darkness had fallen when the guest, having threshed
out the subject to the last grain, took herself off. Mariposa
looked from the opened doorway into a black
street, dotted with the yellow blurs of lighted lamps.
The air was cold with that penetrating, marrow-searching
coldness of a foggy evening in San Francisco.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
As the night swallowed Mrs. Willers, Mariposa
shut the door and came rushing back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; she cried, before she got into her room,
&#8220;isn&#8217;t that the most thrilling thing? Oh, did you ever
know of anything so unexpected and wonderful and
exciting. <i>Do</i> you think he&#8217;ll like my voice? <i>Do</i> you
think he really could be interested in me because he
knew father? And he can&#8217;t have known him so very
well, or father would have said more of him. Did <i>you</i>
ever hear father speak about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother gave no answer, and the girl bent over
her. Lucy, motionless and white, was lying among her
cushions, unconscious.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of her party Mrs.
Willers was giving the finishing touches to her rooms.
These were a sitting and bedroom in one of the large
boarding-houses that already had begun to make their
appearance along Sutter Street. &#8220;To reside&#8221; on Sutter
Street, as she would have expressed it, was a step
in fashion for Mrs. Willers, who previously had lived
in such ignominious localities as North Beach and
upper Market Street, renting the surplus rooms in
dingy &#8220;private families.&#8221; Her rise to fairer fortunes
was signalized by the move to Sutter Street. Her parlor
announced it in its over-furnished brilliancy. All
the best furniture of the poor lady&#8217;s many migrations
had been squeezed into the little room. The Japanese
fans and umbrellas, flattened against the walls with
pins, were accumulated at some cost, for they represented
one of those strange and unaccountable vagaries
of popular taste that from time to time seize a
community with blighting force. Silk scarfs were
twisted about everything whereon they could twist.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The &#8220;lunch,&#8221; as the hostess called it, had already
been prepared and stood on a side table. Edna, Mrs.
Willers&#8217; daughter, had made many trips up and down
the street that morning collecting its component parts
and bringing them home in paper bags. The ladies in
the lower windows of the house had been aware of
these goings and comings, and so were partly prepared
when, at luncheon, Mrs. Willers casually told
them of the distinguished guest she expected. The
newspaper woman had not lived her life with her eyes
shut and her ears closed, and she knew the value to
the fraction of a hair of this information, and just
how much it would add to her prestige.</p>

<p>She was now fluttering about in a wrapper, and with
a piece of black net tied tight over her forehead.
Through this the forms of dark circular curls outlined
themselves like silhouettes. Mrs. Willers had no war-paint
on, and though she looked a trifle worn, was
much more attractive in appearance than when decorated
with her pink and white complexion and her
spotted veil. Edna, who was already dressed, was a
beautiful, fair-haired child of twelve. The struggles
she had seen her mother pass through, with her eyes
bright and her head high, had developed in her a precocity
of mind that had not spoiled the sweet childishness
of a charming nature. It would be many years
yet before Edna would understand that she had been
the sheet-anchor of the mother who was to her so
clever and so brave; the mother, who, in her moments
of weakness and temptation, had found her child the
one rock to cling to in the welter of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers retired to the bedroom to dress, occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
coming to the doorway in various stages of
d&eacute;shabille to give instructions to the child. Her toilet
was accomplished with mutilated rites, and by the time
the sacrificial moment came of laying on the rouge her
cheeks were too flushed with excitement to need it.
When she did appear it would have been difficult to
recognize her as the woman of an hour earlier. Even
the black silhouettes had passed through a metamorphosis
and appeared as a fluff of careless curls.</p>

<p>The first guest to arrive was the man she had spoken
of as Essex. The ladies at the windows below had
been struck into whispering surprise by his appearance.
San Francisco was still enjoying its original
reputation as a land of picturesque millionaires, who
lived lives of lawlessness and splendor. Men of position
still wore soft felt hats and buttoned themselves
tight into prince-albert coats when they went down to
business in the morning. Perhaps in the traveled circles,
where the Bonanza kings and their associates
lived after European models, there were men who bore
the stamp of metropolitan finish, as Barry Essex did.
But they did not visit Sutter Street boarding-houses
nor wear silk hats when they paid afternoon calls. San
Francisco was still in that stage when this form of
headgear was principally associated in its mind with
the men who drew teeth and sold patent medicines on
the sand lots behind the city hall.</p>

<p>Barry Essex, anywhere, would have been a striking
figure. He was a handsome man of some thirty years,
tall and spare, and with a dark, smooth-shaven face
where the nose was high and the eyes veiled and cold.
He looked like a person of high birth, and there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
stories that he was, though by the left hand. He
spoke with an English accent, and, when asked his
nationality, shrugged his shoulders and said it was
hard to say what it was&mdash;his father had been a Spaniard,
his mother an Englishwoman, and he had been
born and reared in France.</p>

<p>That he was a man of ability and education, superior
to the work he was doing as special writer on Jake
Shackleton&#8217;s paper, <i>The Trumpet</i>, was obvious. But
San Francisco had become so used to mysteriously interesting
strangers, that come from no one knows
where, and suggest an attractively unconventional history,
that the particular curiosity excited by Essex soon
died, and he was merely of moment as the author of
some excellent articles on art, literature and music in
<i>The Sunday Trumpet</i>.</p>

<p>He greeted Mrs. Willers with a friendly fellowship,
then let a quick, surreptitious glance sweep the room.
She saw it, knew what he was looking for, but affected
unconsciousness. His manner was touched by the
slightest suggestion of something elaborate and theatrical,
which, in Mrs. Willers&#8217; mind, seemed to have
some esoteric connection with the silk hat. This he
now&mdash;after slowly looking about for a safe place of
deposit&mdash;handed to Edna with the careless remark:
&#8220;Will you put this down somewhere, Edna?&#8221;</p>

<p>The child took it, flushing slightly. She was accustomed
to being made much of by her mother&#8217;s guests,
and Essex&#8217;s manner stung her little girl&#8217;s pride. But
she put the hat on the piano and retired to her corner,
behind the refreshment table.</p>

<p>A few moments later she opened the door to Jake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Shackleton. Mrs. Willers, red-cheeked and triumphant,
felt that this was indeed a proud moment for
her. She said as much, drawing an amused laugh
from her second guest. He, too, had swept the room
with a quick, investigating glance. This time Mrs.
Willers did not affect unconsciousness, and said
briskly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, our young lady hasn&#8217;t come yet. You&#8217;ll have
to try and put up with me for a while.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would have been difficult for the eye of the deepest
affection to see in the Comstock millionaire the emigrant
of twenty-five years before. A mother might
have been deceived. The lean figure had grown chunky
and heavy. The drawn face was now not full&mdash;it was
the type of face that would never be full&mdash;but was lacking
in the seams that had then furrowed it. The hair
was gray, worn thin on the temples, and the beard,
trimmed and well-tended, was gray, too. Perhaps the
strongest tie with the past was that the man suggested
the same hard, fine-drawn, wiry energy. It still shone
in his narrow, light-colored eyes, and still was to be
seen in his lean, muscular hand, that was frequently
used in gesticulation.</p>

<p>In manner the change was equally apparent. Though
colloquial, his speech showed none of the coarse illiterateness
of the past. His manner was quiet, abruptly
natural, and not lacking in a sort of easy dignity, the
dignity of the man who has won his place among men.
He was dressed with the utmost simplicity. His soft
felt wide-awake was not new, his black prince-albert
coat did not fit him with anything like the elegance
with which Barry Essex&#8217;s outlined his fine shape. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
little purple cravat tied in a bow appeared from beneath
his turned-down collar. It was somewhat shiny
from the brushing of his beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must suppose I&#8217;m anxious to see this young
lady,&#8221; he said, &#8220;after what you&#8217;ve told me about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ask Mr. Essex if I&#8217;ve exaggerated,&#8221; said Mrs.
Willers. &#8220;He knows her, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ve said,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;but
I don&#8217;t think anything could be too complimentary that
was said of Miss Moreau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh!&mdash;better and better,&#8221; said the elder man. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know you knew her, Essex?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned his gray eyes, absolutely cold and non-committal
on Essex, who answered them with an
equally expressionless gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known Miss Moreau for three months,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I met her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shackleton turned back to Mrs. Willers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand from you, Mrs. Willers, that these
ladies are left extremely badly off. Are they absolutely
without means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No-o,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;not exactly that. Mr. Moreau
left a life insurance policy of five thousand dollars.
Mariposa tells me that three thousand of that
went to pay his doctors&#8217; bills and funeral expenses.
He was sick a long time. They are now living on
their capital, and they&#8217;ve been here four months, and
Mrs. Moreau has constant medical attendance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The millionaire gave a little click of his tongue significant
of annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreau had a dozen chances of making his pile, as
every man did in those days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
sort of man who is predestined to leave his family
poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet they worship his memory,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers.
&#8220;He must have been very good to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shackleton made no answer. She was used to reading
his expression, and the odd thought crossed her
mind that this remark of hers was unpleasant to him.</p>

<p>Before she had time to reply a knock at the door
announced the arrival of Mariposa. As she entered
the two men stood up, both looking at her with veiled
eagerness. To Essex his feeling for her was making
her every appearance an event. To Shackleton it was
a moment of quivering interest in a career full of
tumultuous moments.</p>

<p>A slight flush mounted to his face as he met her
eyes. She instinctively looked at him first, with a
charming look, girlish, shy, and deprecating. Her
likeness to her mother struck him like a blow, but she
was an Amazonian Lucy, with all that Lucy had lacked.
He saw himself in the stronger jaw and the firm lips.
Physically she was molded of them both. His heart
swelled with a passionate pride. This, indeed, was his
own child, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.</p>

<p>The introductions over, they resettled themselves,
and Mariposa found herself beside this quiet, gray-haired
man, talking quite volubly. She was not shy
nor nervous, as she had expected to be, but felt peculiarly
at her ease. Looking at her with intent eyes,
he spoke to her of the early days in California, when
he and her parents had come across.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I knew your father in the Sierra, long
ago,&#8221; he said.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_092.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;TO SHACKLETON IT WAS A MOMENT OF QUIVERING INTEREST&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered rather hurriedly, fearful lest
he should ask her if her father had not spoken of him,
&#8220;so Mrs. Willers said. It must have been a long time
ago. Was I there?&#8221; she added with a little smile.</p>

<p>He was taken aback by the question and said, stammeringly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, really now, I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t quite remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said laughing. &#8220;You must
have known father before that. <i>He</i> came over in
forty-nine, you know. I was born twenty-four years
ago up in the mountains, in Eldorado County, in a little
cabin miles above Placerville. Mother&#8217;s often described
the place to me. They left soon after.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lowered his eyes. He was a man of no sentiment
or tenderness, yet something in this false statement,
uttered so innocently by these fresh young lips,
and taught with all the solicitude of love to this simple
nature, pierced like an arrow to the live spot in his
deadened conscience.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was more than twenty-five years ago that I was
there,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You evidently were not born then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my mother was there then. Do you think I
look like her? My father thought I was wonderfully
like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked into the candid face. Memories of Lucy
before his own harsh treatment and the hardships of
her life had broken her, stirred in him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;you&#8217;re very like her. But
you&#8217;re like your father, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; she cried, evidently delighted. &#8220;Do you
really think so? I do want to look like my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he could not help asking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>She stared at him surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like to look like both your parents,
if they were the two finest people in the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Willers cut short the conversation by
asking Mariposa to sing. The girl rose and went directly
to the piano. For days this moment had
been looming before her in nightmare proportions.
She was feverishly anxious to do her best and sickeningly
fearful of failure. Now her confidence was unshaken.
Something&mdash;impossible to say just what&mdash;had
reassured her. Her hands were trembling a little
as she struck the keys, and her first notes showed the
oscillation of nervousness, but soon the powerful voice
began to come more under her control, and she poured
it out exultantly. She never sang better. Her voice,
much too large for the small space, was almost painful
in its resonant force.</p>

<p>Of the two men the elder was without musical
knowledge of any kind. He was amazed and delighted
at what seemed to him an astonishing performance.
But Essex knew that with the proper training and
guidance there were possibilities of a brilliant future
for this handsome and penniless young woman. He
had lived much among professional singers, and he
knew that Mariposa Moreau possessed an unusual
voice. For reasons of his own he did not desire her to
know her own power, and he was secretly irritated
that she had sung so well.</p>

<p>She continued, Shackleton requesting another, and
yet another song. Only the clock chiming four roused
him to the fact that he must go. He was living at his
country place at Menlo Park and had to catch a train.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
He left them with assurances of his delight in the
performance. To Mariposa, as he pressed her hand in
farewell, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again. You&#8217;ve a wonderful voice,
there&#8217;s no mistake about that. It&#8217;s a gift, a great gift,
and it must have its chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl, carried away with the triumph of the afternoon,
said gaily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sing for you whenever you like. Could you
never come up to our cottage on Pine Street and meet
my mother? I know she would like to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The slightest possible look of surprise passed over
his face, gone almost as soon as it had come. Mariposa
saw it, however, and felt embarrassed. She evidently
had been too forward, and looked down, blushing
and uncomfortable. He recovered himself immediately,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, much as I should like to, Miss Moreau.
I am living at Menlo Park, and all my spare time
when business is over is spent in catching trains. But
give your mother my compliments on the possession of
such a daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa and Essex stayed chatting with Mrs. Willers
for some time after Shackleton&#8217;s departure. The
clock had chimed more than once, when finally they
left, and their hostess, exhausted, but exultant, threw
herself back in a chair and watched Edna gather up
the remains of the lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the cakes in the tin, dearie. They&#8217;ll do for to-morrow,
and be sure and cork the bottle tight. There&#8217;s
enough for another time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several other times,&#8221; said Edna, holding the bottle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
of port wine up to the light and squinting at it with
her head on one side. &#8220;It was a cheap party&mdash;they
hardly drank anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa and her companion walked up Sutter
Street with the lagging step of people who find each
other excellent company.</p>

<p>It was the end of a warm afternoon in September,
one of those still, deeply flushed evenings when the
air is tepid and smells of distant fires, and the winged
ants come out of the rotting sidewalks by the thousand.
The west was a clear, thin red smudged with
brown smoke. The houses grew dark and ever darker,
and seemed to loom more solidly black every moment.
They looked dreamlike and mysterious against the fiery
background.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you like it?&#8221; said Mariposa, as they
loitered on, &#8220;my singing, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was excellent, of course. You&#8217;ve got a voice.
But the room was too small&mdash;and such a room to sing
in, all crowded with ridiculous things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa felt hurt. She thought Essex was the
finest, the most elegant and finished person she had
ever met. He seemed to her to breathe the atmosphere
of those great sophisticated cities she had never seen.
In his talks with her he now and then chilled her by
his suggestion of belonging to another and a wiser
world, to which she was a provincial outsider.</p>

<p>This quality was in his manner now, and she began
to feel how raw her poor performance must have
seemed to the man who had heard the great prima
donnas of London and Paris.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;It was a small room, of course,&#8221; she assented, &#8220;but
I had to sing somewhere, and I couldn&#8217;t hire a place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shackleton wanted to hear you, as I understand it.
Mrs. Willers said something about his knowing your
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no question about the coldness of his voice
now. Had Mariposa known more about men she
would have seen he was irritated.</p>

<p>She repeated the fable of her father&#8217;s early acquaintance
with Jake Shackleton, and of the latter&#8217;s
desire expressed to Mrs. Willers, of hearing her sing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Willers is such an ass!&#8221; he said suddenly
and vindictively.</p>

<p>Mariposa was this time hurt for her friend and
spoke up:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you say that. I don&#8217;t think a
woman&#8217;s an ass who can support herself and a child
as she does,&#8221;&mdash;she thought of her sixteen dollars and
added: &#8220;It&#8217;s very hard for a woman to make money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s not an ass that way,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;She&#8217;s
an ass to try and work Shackleton up to the point of
becoming a patron of the arts&mdash;as represented by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned on her with a slight smile, that brought
no suggestion of amusement to his somewhat saturnine
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that her idea?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mariposa felt her hopes as to the training of her
voice becoming mean and vulgar.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he wanted to hear me,&#8221; she said stumblingly,
&#8220;and she said it would be a good thing. And
I have no money to educate my voice, and it&#8217;s all I
have. Why do you seem to disapprove of it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;I?&mdash;disapprove? That would hardly do. Why
even if I wanted to, I have not the right to, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s face flushed. She felt now, that she had
presupposed an intimacy between them which he
wanted politely to suggest did not exist. This was not
by any means the first time Essex had baffled and embarrassed
her. It amused him to do it, but to-day he
was in a bad temper and did it from spleen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow Jake Shackleton doesn&#8217;t suggest himself
to me as a patron of the arts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
he knows Yankee Doodle from God Save the Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa thought of the brilliant article on the
Italian opera, from Bellini to Verdi, that the man beside
her had contributed to last Sunday&#8217;s <i>Trumpet</i>,
and Jake Shackleton&#8217;s enthusiastic admiration of her
singing immediately seemed the worthless praise of
sodden ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; she said desperately, &#8220;you wouldn&#8217;t attach
any importance, if you were I, to his liking my singing?
It was just the way some people like a street
organ simply because it plays tunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t think that. There&#8217;s no reason why
he shouldn&#8217;t know a good voice when he hears it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> think I&#8217;ve got a good voice?&#8221; said Mariposa,
stopping in the street and staring morosely at
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do, dear lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you, really?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, really.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled, and tried to hide it by looking down.</p>

<p>It was hardly in man to continue bad-humored before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
this na&iuml;ve display of pleasure at his commending
word.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really think I might some day become a singer,
a professional singer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile broadened and lit her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always make me feel so stupid&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;as
if I didn&#8217;t amount to anything,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>It was so sweet, so childishly candid, that it melted
the last remnant of his bad temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little goose,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know
I think more of you than I do of any one in San Francisco?
It&#8217;s getting dark; take my arm till we get to
the car.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did so and they moved forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or anywhere else,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<small>RETROSPECT</small></h3>
</div>



<p class="quote">&#8220;Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Acts.</span></p>


<p>After he had put Mariposa on her car, Essex went
down town to the paper with some copy. He was
making a fair living on <i>The Trumpet</i>, and the work he
was doing suited him. He thought it might last the
winter and he had no objections to passing the winter
in San Francisco. Like many of his kind, he felt the
lazy Bohemian charm of the diverse, many-colored,
cosmopolitan city sprawled on its sand dunes. The restaurants
alone made life more worth while than anywhere
else in the country except New York.</p>

<p>To-night he went to one, for dinner, that stood in
Clay Street, a short distance below Kearney. He had
a word to say to the white-clothed chef, who cooked
the dinner in plain sight, on a small oven and grill, beneath
which the charcoal gleamed redly. He stopped
for a moment&#8217;s badinage with the buxom, fresh-faced
French woman who sat at the desk. She was the
chef&#8217;s wife, Madame Bertrand, and liked &#8220;Monsieur
Esseex,&#8221; who spoke her natal tongue as well as she
did. There was evidently truth in one piece of Essex&#8217;s
autobiography. Only a childhood spent in France could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
teach the kind of French he spoke with Madame Bertrand.</p>

<p>He sat long over his dinner, smoking and reading
the evening papers. It was so late when he left that
Bertrand himself came out of his cooking corner and
talked with him about Paris. &#8220;Monsieur Esseex&#8221; knew
Paris as well as Bertrand, some parts of it better. He
had been educated there at one of the large <i>lyc&eacute;es</i>, and
had gone back many times, living now on one side of
the river, now on the other. Bertrand, in his white cap
and apron, conversing with his guest, retained a curious
manner of deference unusual in California.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur is a gentleman of some kind or other,&#8221; he
told madame.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many different kinds of gentlemen in
California,&#8221; returned that lady, oracularly.</p>

<p>It was nearly nine when Essex left the restaurant,
and passing down Kearney Street for a few blocks,
turned to his right and began to mount the ascending
sidewalk that led to his lodgings. These were in an
humble and unfashionable neighborhood in Bush
Street. The house was of a kind whence gentility
has departed. It stood back on the top of two small
terraces, up which mounted two wooden flights of
stairs, one with a list to starboard so pronounced that
Essex had, once or twice, while ascending, thought the
city in the throes of an earthquake.</p>

<p>The darkness of night wrapped it now. As it was
early a light within shone out dimly through two narrow
panes of glass flanking the hall door. He let himself
in and mounted a dirtily carpeted stairway. The
place smelled evilly of old cooking and the smoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
many and various cigarettes, cigars and pipes. It was a
man&#8217;s rooming-house, and the men evidently smoked
where and what they listed. Essex had no idea who
they were and had seen only one of them: a man on
the same floor with him who, he surmised, by the occasional
boisterousness of his entrances, frequently
came home drunk.</p>

<p>His room was one of the best in the house, on the
front, and with a large bay window commanding the
street. It was fairly comfortable and well furnished,
and the draft of soft, chill air that crossed it from the
opened window kept it fresh. Essex, after lighting
the gases in the pendent chandelier, bent and kindled
the fire laid in the grate. Like many foreigners he
found San Francisco cold, and after the manner of his
bringing up would no more have denied himself a fire
when he was chilly, than a glass of wine when he was
thirsty. Different nations have their different extravagances,
and Essex&#8217;s French boyhood had stamped
him with respect for the little comforts of that intelligent
race.</p>

<p>He pulled up an easy-chair and sat down in front of
the small blaze, with his hands out. Its warmth was
pleasant, and he stayed thus, thinking. Presently he
smiled slightly, his ear having caught the sounds of
his fellow lodger&#8217;s stumbling ascent of the stairs. The
man was evidently drunk again, and he wondered
vaguely how he ever managed to mount the terrace
steps with the list to starboard.</p>

<p>The lodger&#8217;s door opened, shut, and there was silence.
Essex&mdash;an earnest reader&mdash;was soon deep in
his book. From this he was interrupted by a step in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the passage and a light knock on the door. In response
to his &#8220;Come in,&#8221; the door opened hesitantly, and
the man from across the hall thrust in his head. It was
a head of wild gray hair, with an old yellow face,
seamed and shriveled beneath it. The eyes, which were
beadily dark and set close to the nose, were bloodshot,
the lips slack and uncertain. A very dirty hand was
curled round the edge of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; said Essex.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my matches agin,&#8221; said the man, in a whiningly
apologetic tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some,&#8221; said Essex, designating his box
on the mantelpiece. &#8220;Take what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger shambled in, and after scratching about
the box with a tremulous hand, secured a bunch. Essex
looked at him with cynical interest. He was miserably
dressed, dirty and ragged. He walked with an apologetic
slouch, as if continually expecting a kick in the
rear. He was evidently very drunk, and the odor of the
liquids he had imbibed compassed him in an ambulating
reek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to you, Doc,&#8221; he said, as he went out. &#8220;So
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later Essex heard a crash from his
neighbor&#8217;s room, and then exclamations of anger and
dole. These continuing with an increased volume, Essex
rose and went to the source of sound. The room
was pitch dark, and from it, as from the entrance to
the cave of the damned, imprecations and lamentations
were issuing in a strenuous flood. With the match he
had brought he lit the gas, and turning, saw his late
visitor holding by the foot-board of the bed, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
overturned a small stand, which had evidently been
surmounted by a nickel clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil do you mean by making such a
noise?&#8221; he said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon, pardon!&#8221; said the other humbly, &#8220;but I
couldn&#8217;t find the gas this time, Doc. This is a small
room, but things do get away somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked stupidly about with his bleared eyes.
The room was small and miserably dirty and uninviting.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a room,&#8221; he said suddenly in a loud, dramatic
tone and with a sweep of his arm, &#8220;for a man
who might er been a bonanza king!&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex turned to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you make any more of this row to-night I&#8217;ll see
that you&#8217;re turned out to-morrow,&#8221; he said haughtily.</p>

<p>He wheeled about on the drunkard as he spoke.
The man&#8217;s sodden face was lit with a flash of malevolent
intelligence, to be superseded immediately by a
wheedling smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seen you before to-day,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll see me again to-night if you don&#8217;t
keep quiet, and this time you won&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You was with a lady, a fine-looking lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&mdash;no more of that talk,&#8221; said Essex threateningly.</p>

<p>The man stopped, looking furtively at him as if half
expecting to be struck. Essex turned toward the
door and passed out. As he did so he heard him mutter:
&#8220;And I&#8217;d seen her before, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in his room the young man took up his book
again, but the thread of his interest was broken. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
mind refused to return to the prescribed channels before
it, but began to drift here and there on the wayward
currents of memory.</p>

<p>The house was now perfectly quiet. The little fire
had fallen together into a pleasant core of warmth
that genially diffused its heat through the room. Essex,
sprawling in his chair, his long arms following
its arms, his finely-formed, loose-jointed hands depending
over the rounded ends, let his dreaming gaze
rest on this red heart of living coal, while his pipe
smoke lay between it and his face in delicate layers.</p>

<p>His thoughts slipped back over childish memories
to his first ones, when he had lived a French boy&#8217;s life
with his mother in Paris.</p>

<p>He remembered her far back in the days when he
sat on her knee and was read to out of fairy books.
She had been very pretty then and very happy, and
had always talked English with him while every one
else spoke French. She had been an Englishwoman,
an actress of beauty and promise, who in the zenith
of her popularity had made what the world called a
fine marriage with a rich Venezuelan, who lived in
Paris. The stories of Essex&#8217;s doubtful paternity were
false. Rose Barry&mdash;Rose Essex, on the stage&mdash;had
been the lawful wife of Antonio Perez, and for ten
years was the happy wife as well.</p>

<p>They were very prosperous in those days. Barry
had gone to the <i>lyc&eacute;e</i> all week and come back every
Friday to the beautiful apartment in the Rue de Ponthieu.
There were lovely spring Sundays when they
drove in the Bois and sometimes got out of the carriage
and walked down the sun-flecked <i>all&eacute;es</i> under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the budding trees. And there were even lovelier winter
Sundays when they loitered along the boulevards
in the crisp, clear cold, with the sky showing leaden
gray through the barring of black boughs, and when
they came home to a parlor lit with fire and lamplight
and had oranges and hard green grapes after dinner.</p>

<p>He had loved his pretty mother devotedly in those
happy days, but for his saturnine, dark-visaged father
he had only a sentiment of uneasy fear. He was
twelve, when at his mother&#8217;s request he was sent to
England to school. He could remember, looking back
afterward, that his mother had not been so pretty or
so happy then.</p>

<p>When he came home from school for vacations she
was living at Versailles in a little house that presented
a secret, non-committal front to the stony street, but
that in the back had a delightful garden full of miniature
fountains and summer-houses and grottoes.
From the wall he could see the mossy trees and
stretches of sun-bathed sward of the Trianon. His
father was not always there when he came. One
Easter vacation he was not there at all, and when he
had asked his mother why, she had burst into sudden,
terrible tears that frightened him.</p>

<p>During the long summer holidays after that Antonio
Perez was only there once over a Sunday. Then he
did not come again, and Barry was glad, for he had
never cared for his father. He passed delightful
days in the Trianon Park with his mother, who was
very silent and had gray hair on her temples. She
walked beside him with a slow step, dragging her rich
lace skirts and with her parasol hanging indolently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
over her shoulder. It pleased him to see that many
people looked at her, but she took no notice of them.</p>

<p>When Barry went back to England to school that
year he began to feel that he knew what was coming.
It came the next vacation. His mother had not dared
to tell him by letter. Her husband had deserted her
and disappeared, leaving her with a few thousand
francs in the bank, and not a friend.</p>

<p>After that there were three miserable years when
they lived in a little apartment on the Rue de S&egrave;vres,
up four flights of stairs with a <i>bonne &agrave; tout faire</i>.
His mother had had to conquer the extravagant habits
of a lifetime, and she did it ill. During the last year
of her life the sale of her jewels kept them. Barry
was eighteen when she died, and those long last days
when she lay on the sofa in the remnants of the rich
and splendid clothes she found it so hard to do without
were burned into his memory forever.</p>

<p>Their furniture&mdash;some of which was rare and handsome&mdash;brought
them in a few hundred francs, and on
this he lived for another year, eking out his substance
with his first tentative attempts at journalism. When
he was twenty-one he received a legal notice that his
father had died in Venezuela, leaving him all he possessed,
which, debts paid and the estate settled,
amounted to about ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>This might have been a fortune to the youth, but
the bitter bread he had eaten had soured the best in
him. He took his legacy and resolved to taste of the
joy of life. For several years he lived on the crest
of the wave, now and then diverting himself with journalism,
the only profession that attracted him and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
in which his talents were readily recognized. He saw
much of the world and its ways, living in many cities
and among many peoples. He tried to cut himself
off from the past, adopting, after his mother&#8217;s death,
her old stage name of Essex.</p>

<p>Then, his money spent, there had been a dark interval
of bad luck and despondency, when Barry Essex,
the brilliant amateur journalist, had fallen out of
the ranks of people that are seen and talked about.
Without means, he sank to the level of a battered and
out-at-elbows Bohemian. There was a year or two
when he swung between London and Paris, making
money as he could and not always frequenting creditable
company. Then the tide of change struck him
and he went to New York, worked there successfully
till once again the <i>Wanderlust</i> carried him farther
afield.</p>

<p>He had now arrived at the crucial point of his career.
In his vagabond past there were many episodes best
left in darkness, but nothing that stamped him as an
outcast by individual selection. Shady things were
behind him in that dark, morose year when he found
disreputable company to his taste. But he had never
stepped quite outside the pale. There had always been
a margin.</p>

<p>Now he stood on that margin. He was thirty years
old with shame and bitterness behind him, and before
him the dead monotony of a lifetime of work. He
hated it all. No memory sustained him. The past
was as sore to dwell on as the future was sterile. It
was the parting of the ways. And where they parted
he saw Mariposa standing drawing him by the hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
one way, while he gently but persistently drew her the
other.</p>

<p>In his softly lit library in his great house at Menlo
Park another man was at that time also thinking of
Mariposa. He had been thinking of her off and on
ever since he had bidden her good by that afternoon at
Mrs. Willers&#8217;.</p>

<p>As the train had whirled him over the parched,
thirsty country, burnt to a leathern dryness by the
summer&#8217;s drouth, he had no thought for anything but
his newly discovered daughter. His glance dwelt unseeing
on the tanned fields with their belts of olive
eucalyptus woods, and the turquoise blue of the bay
beyond the painted marsh. Men descending at way
stations raised their hats to him as they mounted into
the handsome carriages drawn up by the platform.
His return to their salutes was a preoccupied nod.
His mind was full of his child&mdash;his splendid daughter.</p>

<p>Jake Shackleton had not forgotten his first wife and
child, as Dan Moreau and Lucy had always hoped.
He was a man of many and secret interests, pulling
many wires, following many trails. He knew their
movements and fortunes from the period of their marriage
in Hangtown. At first this secret espionage was
due to fear of their betraying him. He had begun to
prosper shortly after his entrance into the state, and
with prosperity and the slackening of the strain of the
trip across the desert came a realization of what he
had done. He saw quickly how the selling of his
wife would appeal to the California mind in those
days fantastically chivalrous to women. He would be
undone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>With stealthy persistence he followed the steps of
the peaceful couple who had it in their power to ruin
him. Serenity began to come to him as he heard that
the union was singularly happy; that Moreau, confident
no one would molest them, had gone through a
ceremony of marriage with Lucy, and that the child
was being brought up as their own.</p>

<p>As wealth came to Shackleton he thought of them
with a sort of jealous triumph. With his remarkable
insight into men he knew that Dan Moreau would
never make money; that he was one of the world&#8217;s
predestined poor men. Then as riches grew and grew,
and the emigrant of the fifties became the bonanza
king of the seventies, he wondered if the time might
not come when they would turn to him.</p>

<p>He would have liked it, for under the cold indifference
of his manner the transaction at the cabin in the
Sierra forever haunted him with its savage shamelessness.
It was the one debasing blot on a career which,
hard, selfish, often unprincipled, had yet never, before
or after, sunk to the level of that base action.</p>

<p>When Moreau died at Santa Barbara Shackleton
heard it with a sense of relief. He was secretly becoming
very anxious to see his child. Bessie had
borne him two children, a boy and a girl, and it was
partly the disappointment in these that made him desirous
of seeing Mariposa. He knew and Bessie knew
that she was his only legitimate child. Though he had
virtually entered California with but one wife, and the
blot of Mormonism had been wiped from his record
before he had been two days in the state, the rumor
that he had once been a Mormon still carelessly passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
from mouth to mouth. Should it ever become known
that there had been a former wife, Bessie and her children
would have no lawful claim on him, though the
children, as acknowledged and brought up by him,
would inherit part of his estate.</p>

<p>With his great wealth the pride that was one of the
dominant characteristics of his hard and driving nature
grew apace. He had money by millions, but no
one to do it credit. It would have been the crowning
delight of his tumultuous career to have a beautiful
daughter or talented son to grace the luxury that
surrounded him. But Bessie&#8217;s children were neither
of these things. They were dull and commonplace.
Maud was fat and heavy both in mind and body, while
Winslow was, to his father, a slow-witted, characterless
youth, without the will, energy or initiative of
either of his parents. Affection not grounded on admiration
was impossible to Shackleton, who sometimes
in his exasperation,&mdash;for the successful man bore disappointment
ill,&mdash;would say to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are not my real children; I have only one
child&mdash;Dan Moreau&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the death of Moreau he learned that Lucy and
Mariposa were in San Francisco. There he lost trace
of them and was forced to consult a private detective
who had done work for him before. It was an easy
matter to find them, and only a few letters passed between
him and the detective. In these the man gave
the address and financial condition of the ladies and
added that the daughter was said to be &#8220;a beautiful,
estimable and accomplished young woman.&#8221; This
fired still further the father&#8217;s desire to see her. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
learned, too, of their crippled means and it pleased him
to think that now they might be dependent on him.
But he shrank with an unspeakable repugnance from
the thought of seeing Lucy again, and he was for
weeks trying to find some way of meeting Mariposa
and not meeting her mother. It was at this stage
that, purely by accident, he learned that Mrs. Willers&#8217;
daughter was one of Mariposa&#8217;s pupils. A day or two
after he summoned Mrs. Willers to the interview that
finally brought about the meeting.</p>

<p>Satisfied pride was still seething in him when he
alighted from the train and entered the waiting carriage.
This magnificent girl was worthy of him,
worthy of the millions that were really hers. She had
everything the others lacked&mdash;beauty, charm, talents.
Her whole air, that regalness of aspect which sometimes
curiously distinguishes the simple women of the
West, appealed passionately to his ambition and love
of success. She was born to conquer, to be a queen of
men. The image of Maud rose beside her, and seemed
clumsier and commoner than ever. The father felt a
slight movement of distaste and irritation against his
second daughter, who had supplanted in his home and
in the world&#8217;s regard his elder and fairer child.</p>

<p>The carriage turned in through a lofty gate and
rolled at a slackened pace up a long winding drive.
Jacob Shackleton&#8217;s Menlo Park estate was one of the
showy ones of that gathering place of rich men&#8217;s mansions.</p>

<p>The road wound for some half mile through a
stretch of uncultivated land, dotted with the forms of
huge live-oaks. The grass beneath them was burnt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
gray and was brittle and slippery. The massive trees,
some round and compact and so densely leaved that
they were as impervious to rain as an umbrella, others
throwing out long, gnarled arms as if spellbound in
some giant throe of pain, cast vast slanting shadows
upon the parched ground. Some seemed, like trees
in Dor&eacute;&#8217;s drawings, to be endowed with a grotesque,
weird humanness of aspect, as though an imprisoned
dryad or gnome were struggling to escape, causing the
mighty trunk to bow and writhe, and sending tremors
of life along each convulsed limb. A mellow hoariness
marked them all, due to their own richly subdued coloring
and the long garlands of silvery moss that hung
from their boughs like an eldrich growth of hair.</p>

<p>A sudden greenness in the sward and brilliant
glimpses of flower-beds pieced in between dark tree-trunks,
told of the proximity of the house. It was a
massive structure, architecturally ugly, but gaining a
sort of majesty from its own ponderous bulk and from
the splendor of lawns and trees about it. The last
level rays of the sun were now flooding grass and
garden, piercing bosky thickets where greens melted
into greens, and sleeping on stretches of close-cropped
emerald turf. From among the smaller trees the lordly
blue pines&mdash;that with the oaks were once the only
denizens of the long rich valley&mdash;soared up, lonely and
somber. Their crests, stirred by passing airs, emitted
eolian murmurings, infinitely mournful, as if repining
for the days when they had ruled alone.</p>

<p>At the bend in the drive where the road turned off
to the stables Shackleton alighted and walked over the
grass toward the house. The curious silence that is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
marked a characteristic of the California landscape
wrapped the place and made it seem like an enchanted
palace held in a spell of sleep. Not a leaf nor pendent
flower-bell stirred. In this hour of warmth and stillness
evanescent breaths of fragrance rose from the
carpets of violets that were beginning to bloom about
the roots of the live-oaks.</p>

<p>As he reached the house Maud and a young man
came round the corner and approached him. The girl
was dressed in a delicate and elaborate gown of pale
pink frilled with much lace, and with the glint of falling
ribbons gleaming here and there. She carried a
pink parasol over her shoulder, and against the background
of variegated greens her figure looked modish
as a fashion-plate. It was a very becoming and elegant
costume, and one in which most young girls
would have looked their best.</p>

<p>Maud, who was not pretty, was the type of woman
who looks least well in handsome habiliments. Her
irremediable commonness seemed thrown into higher
prominence by adornment. The softly-tinted dress
robbed her pale skin of all glow and made her lifeless
brown hair look duller. She had a round, expressionless
face, prominent pale-blue eyes, and a chin that receded
slightly. She was not so plain as she was without
vivacity, interest, or sparkle of youth. With her
matter-of-fact manner, heavy figure, and large, unanimated
face she might have been forty instead of
twenty-one.</p>

<p>She was somewhat laboriously coquetting with her
companion, a tall, handsome young Southerner, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
six or seven years her senior, whom her father recognized
as one of his superior clerks and shrewdly suspected
of matrimonial designs. At sight of her parent
a slight change passed over her face. She smiled, but
not so spontaneously; her speech faltered, and she
said, coming awkwardly forward:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Popper! you&#8217;re late to-day; were you delayed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently, considering I&#8217;m an hour later than usual.
Howdy, Latimer; glad to see you down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at them with the slightest
inquiring smile. Though he said nothing to indicate
it, both, knowing him in different aspects, felt he was
not pleased. His whole personality seemed to radiate
a cold antagonism.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good you got down anyhow,&#8221; said Maud constrainedly;
&#8220;this is much nicer than town, isn&#8217;t it, Mr.
Latimer?&#8221;</p>

<p>All the joy had been taken out of Latimer by his
chief&#8217;s obvious and somewhat terrifying displeasure.
Had he been alone with Maud, he would have known
well how to respond to her remark with Southern fervency
of phrase. But now he only said with stiff politeness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is quite ideal!&#8221; and lapsed into uncomfortable
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it some one interesting that made you late?&#8221;
queried Maud, as her father made no attempt to continue
the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; he responded; &#8220;handsome and interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell us about them?&#8221; the girl asked, feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
that the word &#8220;handsome&#8221; contained a covert allusion
to her own lack of beauty of which she was extremely
sensitive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, and I don&#8217;t think it would interest you
much, anyway. Is your mother indoors?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl nodded and he turned away and disappeared
round the corner of the house. She and Latimer
sauntered on.</p>

<p>&#8220;The handsome and interesting person doesn&#8217;t seem
to have made your paternal any fuller than usual of
the milk of human kindness,&#8221; said the young man,
whose suit had progressed further than people guessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Popper&#8217;s often like that,&#8221; said Maud slowly,&mdash;and
in a prettier and more attractive girl the tone and
manner of the remark would have been charmingly
plaintive,&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what makes him so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He can be more like a patent congealing ice-box
when he wants to be than anybody I ever saw. But I
don&#8217;t see why he should be so to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, either, but he is often. He never says anything
exactly disagreeable, but he makes me feel sort
of&mdash;of&mdash;mean. Sometimes I think he doesn&#8217;t like me
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, bosh!&#8221; said Latimer gallantly; &#8220;if that&#8217;s the
case he&#8217;s ripe for a commission of lunacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shackleton meantime had entered the house and
ascended to his dressing-room. He was in there making
the small change which marked his dinner from
his business toilet when his wife entered.</p>

<p>The years had turned Bessie into a buxom, fine-looking
matron, fashionably dressed, but inclined to be very
stout. Her eye and its glance were sharp and keen-edged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
still alight with vigor and alertness. It was
easy to see why Jake Shackleton, the reader of character,
had set aside his feeble first wife for this dominating
and forceful partner. He had been faithful to her;
after a fashion had loved her, and certainly admired
her, for she had the characteristics he most respected.</p>

<p>In his success she had been the same assistance that
she had been in his poverty. She had climbed the social
heights and conquered the impregnable position
they now occupied. Her rich dress, her handsome appearance,
her agreeably modulated voice, all were in
keeping with the position and great wealth that were
theirs. The house of which she was the mistress was
admirably ordered and sumptuously furnished. She
had only disappointed him in one way&mdash;her children.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you late?&#8221; she, too, asked; &#8220;several
people came down this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was detained&mdash;a girl Mrs. Willers wanted me to
see; who&#8217;s here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Latimer, and Count de Lamolle, and George Herron
and the Thurston girls; and the Delanceys are
coming over to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded at the names&mdash;Bessie knew well how to
arrange her parties. The Thurstons were two impoverished
sisters of great beauty and that proud
Southern stock of which early California thought so
highly and rewarded in most cases with poverty.
Count de Lamolle was a distinguished foreigner that
she was considering for Maud. The other two young
men filled in nicely. The Delanceys were a brother
and sister, claimants of the great Delancey Grant,
which was now in litigation. It had come into their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
possession by the marriage of their grandmother,
the Senorita Concepcion de Briones, in &#8217;36, to the
Yankee skipper, Jeremiah Delancey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the girl Mrs. Willers wanted you to see?&#8221;
Bessie asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll tell you about her to-morrow. It&#8217;s a long
story, and I don&#8217;t want to be hurried over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had made up his mind that he would tell Bessie
he had seen and intended to assist his eldest child. He
had always been frank with her and he was not going
to dissemble now. He knew that with all her faults
she was a generous woman.</p>

<p>From his first meeting with her, Barry Essex had
conceived a deep interest in Mariposa. He had known
women of many and divers sorts, and loved a few
after the manner of his kind, which was to foster indolently
a selfish caprice. Marriage was out of the
question for him unless with money, and some instinct,
perhaps inherited from his romantic and deeply-loving
mother, made this singularly repugnant to his nature,
which was neither sensitive nor scrupulous. The mystery
and hazard of life appealed passionately to him,
and to exchange this for the dull monotony of a rich
marriage was an unbearably irksome thought to his
unrestrained and adventurous spirit.</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s charm had struck him deep. He had
never before met that combination of extreme simplicity
of character with the unconscious majesty of
appearance which marked the child of the far West.
He saw her in that Europe, which was his home, as
a conquering queen; and he thought proudly of
himself as the owner of such a woman. Moreover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
he was certain that her voice, properly trained and directed,
would be a source of wealth. She seemed to
him the real vocal artist, stupid in all but one great
gift; in that, pre&euml;minent.</p>

<p>Mariposa was trembling on the verge of a first love.
She had never seen any one like Essex and regarded
him as the most distinguished and brilliant of beings.
His attentions flattered her as she had never been flattered
before, and she found herself constantly wondering
what he saw in a girl who must appear to him so
raw.</p>

<p>Her experience of men was small. Once in Sacramento,
when she was eighteen, she had received an
offer from a young lawyer, and two years ago, in Santa
Barbara, she had been the recipient of a second, from
a prosperous rancher. Both had been refused without
hesitation, and had left no mark on imagination or
heart. Then, at a critical period of her life&mdash;lonely,
poor, a stranger in a strange city&mdash;she had fallen in
with Essex, and for the first time felt the thrill at the
sound of a footstep, the quickening pulse and flushing
cheek at the touch of a hand, that she had read of in
novels. She thought that nobody had seen this; but
the eyes of the dangerous man under whose spell she
had fallen were watching her with wary yet ardent
interest.</p>

<p>He had known her now for three months and had
seen her frequently. His visits at the Pine Street cottage
were augmented by occasional meetings at Mrs.
Willers&#8217;, when that lady was at home and receiving
company, and by walks together. Of late, too, he had
asked her to go to the theater with him. Lucy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
always included in these invitations, but was unable
to go. The theater was an untarnished delight to
Mariposa, and to refuse her the joy of an evening
spent there was not in the mother&#8217;s heart. Moreover,
Lucy, in her agony at the thought of leaving the girl
alone in the world, watched Essex with a desperate
anxiety trying to fathom his feelings. It seemed to
the unworldly woman, that this attractive gentleman
might have been sent by fate to be the husband who
was to love and guard the child when the mother was
gone.</p>

<p>A few days after the party at Mrs. Willers&#8217; rooms
Essex had invited Mariposa to go with him to a performance
of &#8220;Il Trovatore,&#8221; to be given at Wade&#8217;s
opera-house. The company, managed by a Frenchman
called Lepine, was one of those small foreign
ones that in those days toured the West to their own
profit and the pleasure of their audiences. The star
was advertised as a French diva of European renown.
Essex had heard her on the continent, and pronounced
her well worth hearing, if rather too fat to be satisfying
to the esthetic demands of the part of Leonora.
Grand opera was still something of a rarity in San
Francisco and it promised to be an occasion. The papers
printed the names of those who had bought boxes.
Mariposa had read that evening that Jacob Shackleton
would occupy the left-hand proscenium box with his
wife and family.</p>

<p>&#8220;His daughter,&#8221; said Mariposa, standing in front
of the glass as she put on finishing touches, &#8220;is ugly,
Mrs. Willers says. I think that&#8217;s the way it ought to
be. It wouldn&#8217;t be fair to be an heiress and handsome.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be fair for you to be an heiress, certainly,&#8221;
commented the mother from her armchair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I abuse the privilege a penniless
girl has of being good-looking?&#8221; said Mariposa, turning
from the glass with a twinkling eye.</p>

<p>She looked her best and knew it. Relics of better
days lingered in the bureau drawers and jewel boxes
of these ladies as they did in the small parlor. That
night they had been mustered in their might for Mariposa&#8217;s
decking. She was proud in the consciousness
that the dress of fine black lace she wore, through the
meshes of which her statuesque arms and neck gleamed
like ivory, was made from a shawl that in its day had
been a costly possession. Her throat was bare, the
lace leaving it free and closing below it. Where the
black edges came together over the white skin a small
brooch of diamonds was fastened. Below the rim of
her hat, her hair glowed like copper, and the coloring
of her lips and cheeks was deepened by excitement into
varying shades of coral.</p>

<p>As they entered the theater, Essex was aware that
many heads were turned in their direction. But Mariposa
was too imbued with the joyous unusualness of
the moment to notice it. She had forgotten herself
entirely, and sitting a little forward, her lips parted,
surveyed the rustling and fast-filling house.</p>

<p>The glow of the days of Comstock glory was still
in the air. San Francisco was still the city of gold
and silver. The bonanza kings had not left it, but
were trying to accommodate themselves to the palaces
they were rearing with their loose millions. Society
yet retained its cosmopolitan tone, careless, brilliant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and unconventional. There were figures in it that
had made it famous&mdash;men who began life with a pick
and shovel and ended it in an orgy of luxury;
women, whose habits of early poverty dropped from
them like a garment, and who, carried away by their
power, displayed the barbaric caprices of Roman empresses.</p>

<p>The sudden possession of vast wealth had intoxicated
this people, lifting them from the level of the
commonplace into a saturnalia of extravagance. Poverty,
the only restraint many of them had ever felt,
was gone. Money had made them lawless, whimsical,
bizarre. It had developed all-conquering personalities,
potent individualities. They were still playing
with it, wondering at it, throwing it about.</p>

<p>Essex let his glance roam over the audience, that
filled the parquet, and the three horseshoes above
it. It struck him as being more Latin than American.
That foreignness which has always clung to California
was curiously pronounced in this gathering of
varied classes. He saw many faces with the ebon hair
and olive skins of the Spanish Californians, lovely
women, languid and fawn-eyed, badly dressed&mdash;for
they were almost all poor now, who once were lords
of the soil.</p>

<p>The great Southern element which, in its day, set
the tone of the city and contributed much to its traditions
of birth and breeding, was already falling into
the background. Many of its women had only their
beauty left, and this they had adorned, as Mariposa
had hers, with such remnants of the days when
Plancus was consul, as remained&mdash;bits of jewelry, old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and unmodish but cumbrously handsome, edgings of
lace, a pale-colored feather in an old hat, a crape shawl
worn with an air, a string of beads carried bravely,
though beads were no longer in the mode.</p>

<p>An arrogant air of triumph marked the Irish Californians.
With the opening up of the Comstock they
had stuck their flag on the summit of the heights.
They had always found California kindly, but by the
discovery of that mountain of silver they had become
kings where they were once content to serve. The
Irish face, sometimes in its primeval, monkey-like ugliness,
sometimes showing the fresh colored, blowsy
prettiness of the colleens by their native bogs, repeated
itself on every side. Now and then one of them shone
out like a painting by Titian&mdash;the Hibernian of the
red-gold hair and milk-white skin, refined by luxury
and delicate surroundings into a sumptuous and arresting
beauty. Many showed the metal that had carried
their fathers on to victory. Others were only
sleek, smooth-skinned animals, lazy, sensuous, and sly.
And these women, whose mothers had run barefoot,
were dressed with the careless splendor of those to
whom a diamond is a detail.</p>

<p>Essex raised his glass from the perusal of the sea
of faces, to the box which the Shackleton party had
just entered. There was no question about the Americanism
of this group, the young man thought, as he
stared at Jake Shackleton. Square-set and unadorned,
in the evening dress which Bessie made him wear, he
sat back from the velvet railing, an uncompromising
figure of dynamic force, unbeautiful, shrewd, the most
puissant presence in that brilliant assemblage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>The two ladies in the front of the box were Mrs.
and Miss Shackleton. The former was floridly handsome,
almost aristocratic, the gazer thought, looking
at her firmly-modeled, composed face under its roll
of gray hair. The daughter was very like her father,
but ugly. Even in the costly French costume she wore,
with the gleam of diamonds in her hair, about her neck,
in the lace on her bosom, she was ugly. Essex, with
that thought of marrying money in the background
of his mind, scrutinized her. To rectify his fortune in
such a way became more repugnant than ever. If
Mariposa had only been Jake Shackleton&#8217;s daughter
instead!</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her. She met his glance
with eyes darkened by excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Mr. Shackleton in the box,&#8221; she said eagerly,
in a half-whisper. &#8220;Did you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been looking, and that&#8217;s his daughter,
Maud Shackleton, in the white with diamonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it? Oh, what a beautiful dress! and quantities
of diamonds. Almost too many; they twinkle like
water, as if some one had squeezed a sponge over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you do when you&#8217;re a bonanza king&#8217;s
daughter and as ugly as that? You&#8217;ve got to keep up
your end of the line some way. She evidently thinks
diamonds are the best way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex took the glass and looked at the bedecked
heiress again. After some moments he put it down
and turned to Mariposa with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know I&#8217;m going to say something very
funny, but look at her well. Does she look like anybody
you know?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The girl looked and shook her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Like her father a little,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but no one else
I can think of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not her father. Some one you know intimately
and see often&mdash;very often, if you&#8217;re as vain as
you ought to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; she demanded, frowning and looking puzzled;
&#8220;I can&#8217;t think whom you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yourself; she looks like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa gave a quick look at the girl and then at
Essex. For the moment she thought he was mocking
her, but with her second look at the box, the likeness
suddenly struck her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; she said slowly, reaching for the glass;
&#8220;yes,&#8221; putting it down, &#8220;I see it&mdash;she is. How funny!
and fancy your telling me on top of the statement that
she was so ugly! I don&#8217;t see how I can smile again
this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled with the words on her lips, the charming
smile of a woman who knows her silliest phrases are
delightful to one man at least.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not entirely like her?&#8221; she asked, with a somewhat
anxious air; &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got those pale-gray, prominent
eyes, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;ve got mysterious dark eyes, as deep as
wells, and when I look into them, down, down, I sometimes
wonder if I can see your heart at the bottom.
Can I? Let me see.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned forward as if to look straight into her
eyes. Mariposa suddenly flushing and feeling uncomfortable,
dropped them. The sensation she so often
experienced with Essex, of being awkward and raw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
was intensified now by the annoyed embarrassment
provoked by the florid gallantry of his words. But
she was too inexperienced a little fly to deal with this
cunning spider, and tangled herself worse in the web
by saying nervously:</p>

<p>&#8220;And my nose! I haven&#8217;t got that kind of nose?
Oh, surely not,&#8221; putting up a gloved hand to feel of
its unsatisfactoriness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the dearest little nose in the world,
straight as a Greek statue&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a little bit haughty,
but I like it that way. And your mouth,&#8221; he dropped
his voice slightly, &#8220;your mouth&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa made a sudden movement of annoyance.
She threw up her head and looked at the curtain with
frowning brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said sharply, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like you to talk
about me like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex was silent, regarding her profile with a deliberating
eye and a slight, amused smile. How crude
she was and how handsome! After a moment&#8217;s silence,
he leaned toward her and said in a voice full of good-humored
banter:</p>

<p>&#8220;Butterfly! Butterfly! Why did they call you Butterfly?&#8221;</p>

<p>The change in his tone and manner put her back at
once on the old footing of gay bonhomie.</p>

<p>&#8220;In English, that way, it sounds dreadful, doesn&#8217;t
it? Fancy me being called Butterfly! I was called
after the flower. My whole name is Mariposa Lily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa Lily!&#8221; he repeated in amused amazement;
&#8220;what an absurd name!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; said Mariposa indignantly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
anything absurd about it. I think it very pretty. My
mother called me after the flower, the first time she
saw it. They couldn&#8217;t find a suitable name for me for
a long time, and then when she saw the flower she
decided at once to call me after it. It&#8217;s the most beautiful
wild flower in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fortunate you were not called Eschscholtzia,&#8221;
said Essex, who thought the name extremely ridiculous,
and who found a somewhat mean amusement in
teasing the girl; &#8220;you might just as well have been
called Eschscholtzia Poppy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spirited reply which was on Mariposa&#8217;s lips was
stopped by the rising of the curtain. The crowded,
rustling house settled itself into silence, the orchestra&#8217;s
subdued notes rolled out with the voices swelling
above them into the listening auditorium.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was an enchanted dream to
her. She had never seen an opera, and for the first
time realized what it might mean to possess a voice.
She heard the house thunder its applause to Leonora,
and thought of herself as singing thus, standing alone
on that dim stage, looking out over the sea of faces,
all listening, all staring, all spellbound, hanging on
the notes that fell, sweet and rich, thrilling and passionate,
from her lips. Could there ever be such a
life for her? Did they tell the truth when they spoke
so admiringly of her voice? Could she ever sing like
this? A surge of exultant conviction rose in her, and
sent its whisper of hope and ambition to her throbbing
brain.</p>

<p>As the opera progressed she grew pale and motionless.
The wild thought was gaining possession of her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
that she, Mariposa Moreau, with her four pupils and
her sixteen dollars a month, could sing as well as this
woman of European renown, for whom Essex, the
critical, the vastly experienced, had words of praise.
Once or twice it seemed to her as if the notes were
swelling in her own throat, were pressing to burst out
and soar up, higher, fuller, richer than the woman&#8217;s
on the stage. Oh, the rapture of being able to pour
out one&#8217;s voice, to give wild, melodious expression to
love or despair, while a thousand people hung this
way on one&#8217;s lips!</p>

<p>As the curtain fell for the third time she turned
to Essex, pale and large-eyed, and said breathlessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I could sing as well as that woman if I had more
lessons; I know I could! I know it!&#8221;</p>

<p>A week had not passed since the night at the opera
when Mariposa received a hasty letter from Mrs. Willers.
It was only a few lines scrawled on a piece of
the yellow paper affected by the staff of <i>The
Trumpet</i>, and advising the recipient of the fact that
Mr. Shackleton requested her presence at his office at
three the following afternoon, yet a suggestion of
triumph breathed from its every word. Mrs. Willers
was clearly elated at the moment of its production.
She hinted, in a closing sentence, that Mariposa&#8217;s star
was rising rapidly. She, herself, would conduct the
girl to the presence of the great man, and suggested
that Mariposa meet her in her rooms a half-hour before
the time set for the interview.</p>

<p>Mariposa was glad to do this, and in the few moments&#8217;
walk across town toward Third Street, to hear
what Mrs. Willers thought was the object of the interview.
The girl&#8217;s cheeks were dyed with excited
color as they drew near <i>The Trumpet</i> office. Mrs.
Willers was certain it was to do with her singing.
Shackleton had almost told her as much. He had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
immensely impressed by her voice, and now, with the
Lepine Opera Company in the city, Mrs. Willers fancied
he was going to have Lepine, who was a well-known
impresario in a small but respectable way, pass
judgment on it. Mariposa&#8217;s foot lagged when she
heard this. It was such a portentous step from the
seclusion of a rose-draped cottage in Santa Barbara,
even to this talk of singing before a real impresario.
She looked down the vista of Third Street where the
fa&ccedil;ade of <i>The Trumpet</i> office loomed large from humbler
neighbors, and Mrs. Willers saw hesitation and
fright in her eyes. Like a sensible guardian she
slipped her hand through the young girl&#8217;s arm and
walked her briskly forward, talking of the rare chances
life offers to a handicapped humanity.</p>

<p><i>The Trumpet</i> office, as all old San Franciscans know,
stood on Third Street, and was, in its day, considered
a fine building. Jake Shackleton had not been its
owner six months yet, and all his reforms were not
inaugurated. From the yawning arch of its doorway
flights of stairs led up and upward, from stories
where the presses rattled all night, to the editorial
story where the sentiments of <i>The Trumpet</i> staff were
confided to paper. This latter and most important department
was four flights up the dark stairway, which
was lit at its turnings with large kerosene lamps,
backed by tin reflectors. There was little of the luxury
of the modern newspaper office about the barren,
business-like building, echoing like an empty shell to
the shouts of men and the pounding of machinery.</p>

<p>At the top of the fourth flight the ladies paused.
The landing broadened out into a sort of anteroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
bare and windowless, two dejected-looking gas-jets
dispensing a tarnished yellow light into the surrounding
gloom. A boy, with a sleek, oiled head, sat at a
table reading that morning&#8217;s issue of <i>The Trumpet</i>.
He put it down as Mrs. Willers rose before his vision
and nodded familiarly to her. She gave him a quick
word of greeting and swept Mariposa forward
through a doorway, down a long passage, from which
doors opened into tiny rooms with desks and droplights.
The girl now and then had glimpses of men
seated at the desks, the radiance of the droplights hard
on their faces that had been lifted expectantly as their
ears caught the interesting rustle of skirts in the corridor.</p>

<p>Suddenly, at the end of the passage, Mrs. Willers
struck with her knuckles on a closed portal. The next
moment Mariposa, with the light of a large window
shining full on her face, was shaking hands with
Shackleton. Then, in response to his motioning hand,
she took the chair beside the desk, where she sat, facing
the white glare of the window, conscious of his
keen eyes critically regarding her. Mrs. Willers took
a chair in the background. For a moment she had
fears that the nervousness she had noticed in her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e&#8217;s
countenance on the way down would make her
commit some <i>b&ecirc;tise</i> that would antagonize the interest
Shackleton so evidently took in her. Mrs. Willers had
seen her chief&#8217;s brusk impatience roused by follies
more excusable than those that rise from a young
girl&#8217;s nervous shyness and that would be incomprehensible
to his hardy, self-confident nature.</p>

<p>But Mariposa seemed encouragingly composed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
She again felt the curious sense of ease, of being at
home with him, that this unknown man had given
her before. She had that inspiring sensation that she
was approved; that this old-time friend of her father&#8217;s
had a singular unspoken sympathy with her. &#8220;As if
he might have been an old friend,&#8221; she told her mother
after the first meeting, &#8220;or some kind of relation&mdash;one
of those uncles that come back from India in the
English novels.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now only her fluctuating color told of the inward
tumult that possessed her as he told her concisely, but
kindly, that he had arranged for her to sing before
Lepine, the manager of the opera, at two o&#8217;clock on
the following day. Several people of experience had
told him Lepine was an excellent judge. They would
then hear an expert&#8217;s opinion on her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the finest kind of voice,&#8221; he said, smiling,
&#8220;but you know my opinion&#8217;s worth more on ores
than on voices. So we won&#8217;t soar too high till we hear
what the fellow whose business it is, has to say. Then,
if he&#8217;s satisfied&#8221;&mdash;he gave a little shrug&mdash;&#8220;we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interview was brought to an end in a few moments.
It seemed to Mariposa that the scenes which
Mrs. Willers assured her were so big with promise
were incredibly short for moments so fraught with
destiny. She seemed hardly to have caught her
breath yet from the ascent of the four flights of stairs,
when they were once again walking down the corridor,
with the writing men looking up with pricked ears
at the returning rustle of skirts. It was Mrs. Willers
who had wafted her away so quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never beat about the bush where you deal with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Jake Shackleton,&#8221; she said, slipping her hand in Mariposa&#8217;s
arm as they passed down the corridor. &#8220;He&#8217;s
got no use for people who gambol round the subject.
Say your say and then go. That&#8217;s the way to get on
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the anteroom the boy was still sitting, his chair
tilted back on its hind legs, <i>The Trumpet</i> in his hands.
Nevertheless, he had made an incursion into the inner
regions to find out whom Mrs. Willers was piloting
into the sanctum, for he had the curiosity of those who
hang on the fringes of the newspaper world.</p>

<p>As the ladies passed him, going toward the stair-head,
a young man rose above it, almost colliding with
them. Then in the gloom of the dejected gas-jets he
stood aside, against the wall, letting them pass out.
He wore a long ulster with a turned-up collar. Between
the edge of this and the brim of his derby hat,
there was the gleam of a pair of eye-glasses and a
suggestion of a fair mustache. He raised his hat,
holding it above his head during the interval of their
transit, disclosing a small pate clothed with smooth
blond hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that lady with Mrs. Willers?&#8221; he said to
the boy, as he walked toward the door into the corridor.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s some singing lady,&#8221; answered that youth
drawlingly, tilting his chair still farther back, &#8220;what&#8217;s
come to see Mr. Shackleton about singing at the opera-house.
Her name&#8217;s Moreau.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man, without further comment, passed
into the inner hall, leaving the boy smiling with pride
that his carelessly-acquired information should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
been so soon of use. For the questioner was Winslow
Shackleton, the millionaire&#8217;s only son.</p>

<p>The next morning was one of feverish excitement
in the cottage on Pine Street. Mariposa could not settle
herself to anything, at one moment trying her voice
at the piano, at the next standing in front of her glass
and putting on all her own and her mother&#8217;s hats in
an effort to see in which she presented the most attractive
appearance. She thrilled with hope for a
space, then sank into a dead apathy of dejection. Lucy
was quietly encouraging, but the day was one of hidden
anguish to her. The daughter, ignorant of the
knowledge and the memories that were wringing the
mother&#8217;s heart, wondered why Lucy was so confident
of her winning Shackleton&#8217;s approval. As the hour
came for her to go she wondered, too, at the marble
pallor of her mother&#8217;s face, at the coldness of the
hand that clung to hers in a lingering farewell. Lucy
was giving back her child to the father who had deserted
it and her.</p>

<p>The excitement of the morning reached its climax
when a carriage appeared at the curb with Mrs. Willers&#8217;
face at the window. The hour of fate had struck,
and Mariposa, with a last kiss to her mother, ran down
the steps feeling like one about to embark on a journey
upon perilous seas in which lie enchanted islands.</p>

<p>During the drive Mrs. Willers talked on outside
matters. She was business-like and quiet to-day.
Even her clothes seemed to partake of her practical
mood and were inconspicuous and subdued. As the
carriage turned down Mission Street she herself began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to experience qualms. What if they had all been
mistaken and the girl&#8217;s voice was nothing out of the
ordinary? What a cruel disappointment, and with that
sick, helpless mother! What she said was:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, here we are! Remember that you&#8217;ve got
the finest voice Lepine&#8217;s ever likely to hear, and you&#8217;re
going to sing your best.&#8221;</p>

<p>They alighted, and as they turned into the flagged
entrance that led to the foyer, Shackleton came forward
to meet them. He looked older in the crude afternoon
light, his face showing the lines that his
fiercely-lived life had plowed in it. But he smiled
reassuringly at Mariposa and pressed her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s all ready,&#8221; he said; &#8220;Lepine&#8217;s put back
a rehearsal for us, so we mustn&#8217;t keep him waiting.
And are you all ready to surprise us?&#8221; he asked, as
they walked together toward where the three steps led
to the foyer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to do my best,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;a person
can&#8217;t do more than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer pleased him, as everything she said did.
He saw she was nervous, but that she was going to
conquer herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lots of grit,&#8221; he said to himself as he gave ear to
a remark of Mrs. Willers&#8217;. &#8220;She won&#8217;t quit at the first
obstacle.&#8221;</p>

<p>They passed through the opening in the brass rail
that led to the foyer. This space, the gathering place
of the radiant beings of Mariposa&#8217;s first night at the
opera, was now a dimly-lit and deserted hall, its flagged
flooring looking dirty in the raw light. From somewhere,
in what seemed a far, dreamy distance, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
sound of a piano came, as if muffled by numerous
doors. As they crossed the foyer toward the entrance
into the auditorium, the door swung open and two
men appeared.</p>

<p>One was a short and stout Frenchman, with a
turned-over collar, upon which a double chin rested.
He had a bald forehead and eyes that gleamed sharply
from behind a <i>pince-nez</i>. At sight of the trio, he gave
an exclamation and came forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our young lady?&#8221; he said to Mariposa, giving her
a quick look of scrutiny that seemed to take her in
from foot to forehead. Then he greeted Shackleton
with slightly exaggerated foreign effusion. He spoke
English perfectly, but with the inevitable accent. This
was Lepine, the impresario, and the other man, an
Italian who spoke little English, was presented as Signor
Tojetti, the conductor.</p>

<p>They moved forward talking, and then, pushing the
door open, Lepine motioned Mariposa to enter. She
did so and for a moment stood amazed, staring into
a vast, shadowy space, where, in what seemed a vague,
undefined distance, a tiny spot or two of light cut into
the darkness. The air was chill and smelt of a stable.
From somewhere she heard the sound of voices rising
and falling, and then again the notes of a piano, now
near and unobscured, carelessly touched and resembling,
in the echoing hollow spaciousness of the great
building, the thin, tinkling sounds emitted by smitten
glass.</p>

<p>Lepine brushed past her and led the way down the
aisle. As she followed him her eyes became accustomed
to the dimness, and she began to make out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
arch of the stage with blackness beyond, into which
cut the circles of light of a few gas-jets. The lines
of seats stretched before her spectral in linen covers.
Now and then a figure crossed the stage, and as they
drew nearer, she saw on one side of it a man sitting
on a high stool reading a paper book by the light of a
shaded lamp. The notes of the piano sounded sharper
and closer, and by their proximity more than by her
sight, she located it in a dark corner of the orchestra.
As they approached, the sound of two voices came
from this corner, then suddenly a man&#8217;s smothered
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Martinez,&#8221; said Lepine, directing his voice
toward the darkness whence the laugh had risen, &#8220;the
lady is here to sing, if you are ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly a faintly luminous spark, Mariposa had
noticed, bloomed into the full-blown radiance of a gas-jet
turned full cock under a sheltering shade. It projected,
what seemed in the dimness, a torrent of light
on the keyboard of the piano, illuminating a pair of
long masculine hands that had been moving over the
keys in the darkness. Behind them the girl saw a
shadowy shape, and then a spectacled face under a
mane of drooping black hair was advanced into the
light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the lady her music?&#8221; said the face, in English,
but with another variety of accent.</p>

<p>She handed him the two songs she had brought,
&#8220;Knowest thou the Land,&#8221; from Mignon, and &#8220;Farewell,
Lochaber.&#8221; In the short period of her tuition
her teacher had told her that she had sung &#8220;Lochaber&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
admirably. The man opened them, glanced at
the names, and placing the &#8220;Mignon&#8221; aria on the rack,
ran his hands lightly and carelessly over the keys in the
opening bars of the accompaniment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever the lady is ready,&#8221; he said, with an air
of patience, as though he had endured this form of
persecution until all spirit of revolt was crushed.</p>

<p>Mariposa drew back from him, wondering if she
were to sing there and then. Lepine was behind her,
and behind him she saw, with a sense of nostalgic
loneliness, that the Italian conductor was shepherding
Mrs. Willers and Shackleton into two seats on the
aisle. They looked small and far away.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will mount to the stage this way, Mademoiselle,&#8221;
said Lepine, and he indicated a small flight
of steps that rose from the corner of the orchestra to
the lip of the stage above.</p>

<p>He ascended first, she close at his heels, and in a
moment found herself on the dark, deserted stage. It
seemed enormous to her, stretching back into unseen
regions where the half-defined shapes of trees and
castles, walls and benches were huddled in dim confusion.
Down the aisles between side-scenes she
caught glimpses of vistas lit by wavering gleams of
light. People moved here and there, across these
vistas, their footsteps sounding singularly distinct. As
she stood uneasily, looking to the right and left, a sudden
sound of hammering arose from somewhere behind,
loud and vibrant. Lepine, who was about to
descend the stairs, turned and shouted a furious sentence
in Italian down the opening. The hammering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
instantly ceased, and a man in white overalls came and
stared at the stage. The impresario, charily&mdash;being
short and fat&mdash;descended the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, speaking from the
orchestra, &#8220;if you are ready, come forward a little,
nearer the footlights there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa moved forward. Her heart was beating
in her throat, and she felt a sick terror at the thought
of what her voice would be like in that huge void
space. She was aware that the man who had been
reading the paper book had closed it and was leaning
his elbow on the lamp-stand, watching her. She was
also aware that a woman and a man had suddenly appeared
in the lower proscenium box close beside her.
She saw the woman dimly, a fat, short figure in a
light-colored ulster. Whispering to the man, she drew
one of the linen-covered chairs close to the railing and
seated herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the lady ready?&#8221; said the pianist, from his dark
corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite ready,&#8221; replied Mariposa, hearing her voice
like a tremulous thread of sound in the stillness.</p>

<p>The first bars of the accompaniment sounded thinly.
Mariposa stepped forward. She could see in the
shadowy emptiness of the auditorium Lepine&#8217;s bald
head where he sat alone, half-way up the house, and the
two pale faces of Shackleton and Mrs. Willers. The
Italian conductor had left them and was sitting by
himself at one side of the parquet. In the stillness,
the notes of the piano were curiously tinkling and
feeble.</p>

<p>Mariposa raised her chest with a deep inspiration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
A sudden excited expectation seized her at the thought
of letting her voice swell out into the hushed void before
her. The listening people seemed so small and
insignificant in it, they suddenly lost their terror. She
began to sing.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that her first notes were hardly
audible. They seemed as ineffectual as the piano.
Then her confidence grew, and delight with it. She
never before had felt as if she had enough room.
Her voice rolled itself out like a breaking wave, lapping
the walls of the building.</p>

<p>The first verse came to an end. The accompaniment
ceased. Lepine moved in his distant seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Continue, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said sharply; &#8220;the
second verse, if you please. Again, Mr. Martinez.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa saw the woman in the box look at the man
beside her, raise her eyebrows, and nod.</p>

<p>She began the second verse and sang it through.
As its last notes died out there was silence for a moment.
In the silence the Italian conductor rose and
came forward to where Lepine sat. Mariposa, standing
on the stage, saw them conferring for a space. The
Italian talked in a low voice, with much gesticulation.
Shackleton and Mrs. Willers were motionless and
dumb. The woman in the box began to whisper with
the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now the second piece, if Mademoiselle has no
objection,&#8221; came the voice of the impresario across the
parquet. &#8220;One can not judge well from one song.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second song, &#8220;Lochaber,&#8221; had been chosen by
Mariposa&#8217;s teacher to show off her lower register&mdash;those
curious, disturbing notes that were so deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
full of vague melancholy. She had gained such control
as she had over her voice and sang with an almost
joyous exultation. She had never realized what it
was to sing before people who knew and who listened
in this way in a place that was large enough.</p>

<p>When the last notes died away, the tinkling of the
piano sounding like the frail specters of music gafte
the tones of the rich, vibrant voice, there was a sudden
noise of clapping hands. It came from the box on the
right, where the woman in the ulster was leaning over
the rail, clapping with her bare hands held far out.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Brava!</i>&#8221; she cried in a loud, full voice. &#8220;<i>Brava!
La belle voix! Et quel volume! Brava!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She bounced round on her chair to look at the man
beside her, and, leaning forward, clapped again, crying
her gay &#8220;brava.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa walked toward the box, feeling suddenly
shy. As she drew nearer she saw the woman&#8217;s face
more distinctly. It was a dark French face, with a
brunette skin warming to brick-dust red on the cheeks,
set in a frame of wiry black hair, and with a big mouth
that, laughing, showed strong white teeth, well separated.
As Mariposa saw it fairly in the light of an
adjacent lamp she recognized it as that of the Leonora
of &#8220;Il Trovatore.&#8221; It was the prima donna.</p>

<p>She started forward with flushing cheek and held out
a hesitating hand. The fat, ungloved palms of the
singer closed on it with G&aelig;lic effusion. Mariposa was
aware of something delightfully wholesome and kind
in the broad, ruddy visage, with its big, smiling mouth
and the firm teeth like the halves of cleanly-broken
hazelnuts. The singer, leaning over the rail, poured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
a rumbling volume of French into the girl&#8217;s blushing,
upturned face. Mariposa understood it and was trying
to answer in her halting schoolgirl phrases, when
the voice of Mrs. Willers, at the bottom of the steps,
summoned her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down, quick! They think it&#8217;s fine. Oh,
dearie,&#8221; stretching up a helping hand as Mariposa
swept her skirts over the line of the footlights, &#8220;you
did fine. It was great. You&#8217;ve just outdone yourself.
And you looked stunning, too. I only wished
the place had been full. Heavens! but I thought I&#8217;d
die at first. While you were standing there waiting
to begin I felt seasick. It was an awful moment. And
you looked just as cool! Mr. Shackleton don&#8217;t say
much, but I know he&#8217;s tickled to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked up the aisle as she talked to where
Shackleton and the two men were standing in earnest
conversation. As they approached Lepine turned toward
her and gave a slight smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were saying, Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
have unquestionably a voice. The lower register is
remarkably fine. Of course, it is very untrained; absolutely
in the rough. But Signor Tojetti, here, finds
that a strong point in your favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Signor Tojetti,&#8221; said Shackleton, &#8220;seems to think
that two years of study would be ample to fit you for
the operatic stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa looked from one to the other with beaming
eyes, hardly able to believe it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You really did like it, then?&#8221; she said to Lepine
with her most ingenuous air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>He shrugged his shoulders, with a queer French
expression of quizzical amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a truly interesting performance, and after a
period of study with a good master it should be a truly
delightful one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Italian, to whom these sentences were only half
intelligible, now broke in with a quick series of sonorous
phrases, directed to Lepine, but now and then
turned upon Shackleton. Mariposa&#8217;s eyes went from
one to the other in an effort to understand. The impresario,
listening with frowning intentness, responded
with a nod and a word of brusk acquiescence.
Turning to Shackleton, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tojetti also thinks that the appearance of Mademoiselle
is much in her favor. She has an admirable
stage presence&#8221;&mdash;he looked at Mariposa as if she were
a piece of furniture he was appraising. &#8220;Her height
alone is of inestimable value. She would have at
least five feet eight or nine inches.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment the lady in the box, who had risen
to her feet, and was leaning against the railing, called
suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Lepine, vraiment une belle voix, et aussi une belle
fille! Vous avez fait une trouvaille.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Lepine wheeled round to his star, who in the
shadowy light stood, a pale-colored, burly figure, buttoning
her ulster over her redundant chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;A moment,&#8221; he said, apologetically to the others,
and, running to the box, stood with his head back,
talking to her, while the prima donna leaned over and
a rapid interchange of French sentences passed between
them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Signor Tojetti turned to Mariposa, and, with solemn
effort, produced an English phrase:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eet ees time to went.&#8221; Then he waved his hand
toward the stage. The sound of feet echoed therefrom,
and as Mariposa looked, an irruption of vague,
spectral shapes rose from some unseen cavernous entrance
and peopled the orchestra.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the rehearsal,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We must be going.&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved forward toward the entrance, the auditorium
behind them beginning to resound with the
noise of the incoming performers. A scraping of
strings came from the darkened orchestra, and mingled
with the tentative chords struck from the piano. At
the door Lepine joined them, falling into step beside
Shackleton and conversing with him in low tones.
Signor Tojetti escorted them to the brass rail and there
withdrew with low bows. The ladies made out that
the rehearsal demanded his presence.</p>

<p>Once again in the gray light of the afternoon they
stood for a moment at the curb waiting for the carriage.</p>

<p>Lepine offered his farewells to Mariposa and his
wishes to see her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Paris,&#8221; he said, giving his little quizzical smile&mdash;&#8220;that
is the place in which I should like to see Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about that again,&#8221; said Shackleton; &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to see Mr. Lepine before he goes and have another
talk about you. You see, you&#8217;re becoming a
very important young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>The carriage rolled up and Mariposa was assisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
in, several street boys watching her with wide-eyed interest
as evidently a personage of distinction.</p>

<p>Her face at the window smiled a radiant farewell
at the group on the sidewalk; then she sank back
breathless. What an afternoon! Would the carriage
ever get her home, that she might pour it all out to her
mother! What a thrilling, wonderful, unheard-of
afternoon!</p>

</div></div></div>


<p>As the carriage turned the corner into Third Street,
Shackleton and Mrs. Willers, bidding their adieux to
Lepine, started toward <i>The Trumpet</i> office. The
building was not ten minutes&#8217; walk away, and both the
proprietor and the woman reporter had work there
that called them.</p>

<p>In their different ways each was exceedingly elated.
The man, with his hard, bearded face, the upper half
shaded by the brim of his soft felt hat, gave no evidence
in appearance or manner of the exultation that possessed
him. But the woman, with her more febrile
and less self-contained nature, showed her excited
gratification in her reddened cheeks and the sparkling
animation of her tired eyes. Her state of joyous
triumph was witnessed even in her walk, in the way
she swished her skirts over the pavements, in the something
youthful and buoyant that had crept into the
tones of her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that <i>was</i> an experience worth
having! I never heard her sing so before. She just
outdid herself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;She certainly seemed to me to sing well. I was
doubtful at the beginning, not knowing any more about
singing than I do about Sanskrit, as to whether she
really had as fine a voice as we thought. But there
don&#8217;t seem to me to be any doubt about it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lepine is quite certain, is he?&#8221; queried Mrs. Willers,
who had tried to listen to the conversation between
her chief and the impresario on the way out, but
had been foiled by Mariposa&#8217;s excited chatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that she has an unusually fine voice, which,
with proper training, would, as far as they can say
now, be perfectly suitable for grand opera. It&#8217;s what
they call a dramatic mezzo-soprano, with something
particularly good about the lower notes. Lepine is to
see me again before he goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he suggest what she ought to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he spoke of Paris as the best place to send
her. He knows some famous teacher there that he
says is the proper person for her to study with. He
seemed to think that two years of study would be
sufficient for her. She&#8217;d be ready to make her appearance
in grand opera after that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; breathed Mrs. Willers in a transport
of pious triumph, &#8220;just think of it! And now up
in that cottage on Pine Street getting fifty cents a lesson,
and with only four pupils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In two years,&#8221; said Shackleton, who was speaking
more to himself than to her, &#8220;she&#8217;ll be twenty-seven
years old&mdash;just in her prime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be twenty-six,&#8221; corrected Mrs. Willers;
&#8220;she&#8217;s only twenty-four now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>He raised his brows with a little air of amused
apology.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-four, is it?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all the
better. Twenty-six is one year better than twenty-seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be like the &#8216;Innocents Abroad&#8217; to see her and
her mother in Paris,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers. &#8220;They&#8217;re just
two of the most unsophisticated females that ever
strayed out of the golden age.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man vouchsafed no answer to this remark for a
moment; then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The mother&#8217;s health is very delicate? She&#8217;s quite
an invalid, you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite. But she&#8217;s one of the sweetest, most uncomplaining
women you ever laid eyes on. You&#8217;d
understand the daughter better if you knew the mother.
She&#8217;s so gentle and girlish. And then they&#8217;ve lived
round in such a sort of quiet, secluded way. It&#8217;s
funny to me because they had plenty of money when
Mr. Moreau was alive. But they never seemed to go
into society, or know many people; they just seemed
enough for each other, especially when the father was
with them. They simply adored him, and he must
have been a fine man. They&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mrs. Moreau&#8217;s state of health too bad to allow
her to travel?&#8221; said Shackleton, interrupting suddenly
and rudely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers colored slightly. She knew her chief
well enough to realize that his tone indicated annoyance.
Why did he so dislike to hear anything about
the late Dan Moreau?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;As to that I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She&#8217;s so much
of an invalid that she rarely goes out. But with good
care she might be able to take a journey and benefit by
it. A sea trip sometimes cures people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Moreau couldn&#8217;t, and, I have no doubt,
wouldn&#8217;t leave her. It&#8217;ll therefore be necessary for
the mother to go to Paris with the girl, and if she is so
complete and helpless an invalid she&#8217;ll certainly be of
no assistance to her daughter&mdash;only a care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d undoubtedly be a care. But a person
couldn&#8217;t separate those two. They&#8217;re wrapped up in
each other. It&#8217;s a pity you don&#8217;t know Mrs. Moreau,
Mr. Shackleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the second time that afternoon Mrs. Willers
was conscious that words she had intended to be gently
ingratiating had given mysterious offense to her employer.
Now he said, with more than an edge of
sharpness to his words:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt it&#8217;s a pity, Mrs. Willers. But there
are so many things and people it&#8217;s a pity I don&#8217;t know,
that if I came to think it over I&#8217;d probably fall into a
state of melancholia. Also, let me assure you, that I
haven&#8217;t the least intention of trying to separate Mrs.
Moreau and her daughter. What I&#8217;m just now
bothered about is the fact that this lady is hardly of
sufficient worldly experience, and certainly has not
sufficient strength to take care of the girl in a strange
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers with slow reluctance,
&#8220;it would be the other way round, the girl would be
taking care of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I thought. The only way out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
of it will be to send some one with them. A woman
who could take care of them both, chaperone the
daughter and look after the mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Mrs. Willers began to understand
why Mr. Shackleton had walked down to <i>The
Trumpet</i> office with her. The walk was over, for they
were at the office door, and the conversation had
reached the point to which he had evidently intended
to bring it before they parted.</p>

<p>As they turned into the arched doorway and began
the ascent of the stairs, Mrs. Willers replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that would be a very good idea, Mr. Shackleton.
That is, if you can find the right woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got her now,&#8221; he answered, giving her a
quick, side-long glance. &#8220;I think it would be a good
arrangement for all parties. <i>The Trumpet</i> wants a
Paris correspondent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door leading into the press-rooms opened off
the landing they had reached, and he turned into this
with a word of farewell, and a hand lifted to his hat
brim. Mrs. Willers continued the ascent alone. As
she mounted upward she said to herself:</p>

<p>&#8220;The best thing for me to do is to get a French
phrase book on the way home this evening, and begin
studying: &#8216;Have you the green pantaloons of the miller&#8217;s
mother?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The elation of his mood was still with Shackleton
when, two hours later, he alighted from the carriage
at the steps of his country house. He went upstairs
to his own rooms with a buoyant tread. In his library,
with the windows thrown open to the soft, scented air,
he sat smoking and thinking. The October dusk was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
closing in, when he heard the wheels of a carriage on
the drive and the sound of voices. His women-folk
with the second of the Thurston girls&mdash;the one guest
the house now contained&mdash;were returning from the
afternoon round of visits that was the main diversion
of their life during the summer months, and swept the
country houses from Redwood City to Menlo Park.</p>

<p>It was a small dinner table that evening. Winslow
had stayed in town over night, and Shackleton sat at
the head of a shrunken board, with Bessie opposite
him, his daughter to the left, and Pussy Thurston on
his right. Pussy was Maud&#8217;s best friend and was one
of the beauties of San Francisco. To-night she looked
especially pretty in a pale green crape dress, with green
leaves in her fair hair. Her skin was of a shell-like
purity of pink and white, her face was small, with
regular features and a sweet, childish smile.</p>

<p>She and her sister were the only children of the
famous Judge Beauregard Thurston, in his day one
of those brilliant lawyers who brought glory to the
California bar. He had made a fortune, lived on it
recklessly and magnificently, and died leaving his
daughters almost penniless. He had been in the heyday
of his splendor when Jake Shackleton, just struggling
into the public eye, had come to San Francisco,
and the proud Southerner had not scrupled to treat
the raw mining man with careless scorn. Shackleton
evened the score before Thurston&#8217;s death, and he still
soothed his wounded pride with the thought that the
two daughters of the man who had once despised him
were largely dependent on his wife&#8217;s charity. Bessie
took them to balls and parties, dressed them, almost fed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
them. The very green crape gown in which Pussy
looked so pretty to-night had been included in Maud&#8217;s
bill at a fashionable dressmaker&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Personally he liked Pussy, whose beauty and winning
manners lent a luster to his house. Once or twice
to-night she caught him looking at her with a cold,
debating glance in which there was little of the admiration
she was accustomed to receiving since the days of
her first long dress.</p>

<p>He was in truth regarding her critically for the first
time, for the Bonanza King was a man on whom the
beauty of women cast no spell. He was comparing
her with another and a more regally handsome girl.
Pussy Thurston would look insipid and insignificant
before the stately splendor of his own daughter.</p>

<p>He smiled as he realized Mariposa&#8217;s superiority.
The young girl saw the smile, and said with the privileged
coquetry of a maid who all her life has known
herself favored above her fellows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you smiling all to yourself, Mr. Shackleton?
Can&#8217;t we know if it is something pleasant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was looking at something pretty,&#8221; he answered,
his eyes full of amusement as they rested on her charming
face. &#8220;That generally makes people smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was so used to such remarks that her rose-leaf
color did not vary the fraction of a shade. Maud, to
whom no one ever paid compliments, looked at her
with wistful admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; she said with an air of disappointment.
&#8220;I hoped it was something that would make us
all smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have an idea that may make you all smile&#8221;&mdash;he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
turned to his wife&mdash;&#8220;how would you like to go
to Europe next spring, Bessie?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Shackleton looked surprised and not greatly
elated. On their last trip to Europe, two years before,
her husband had been so bored by the joys of foreign
travel that she had made up her mind she would never
ask him to go again. Now she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t want to go to Europe. You said
last time you hated it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I? Yes, I guess I did. Well, I&#8217;m prepared
to like it this time. We could take a spin over in the
spring to London and Paris. We&#8217;d make quite a stay
in Paris, and you women could buy clothes. You&#8217;d
come, too, Pussy, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said, turning to
the girl.</p>

<p>Her color rose now and her eyes sparkled. She had
never been even to New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; she said. &#8220;That <i>does</i> make me
smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; he answered good-humoredly&mdash;&#8220;and
Maud, you&#8217;d like it, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud did not like the thought of going at all. In
this little party of four, two were moved in their actions
by secret predilections of which the others were
ignorant. Maud thought of leaving her love affair at
the critical point it had reached, and, with anguish at
her heart, looked heavily indifferent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, crumbling her bread, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s such fun in Europe. You just travel
round in little stuffy trains, and have to live in hotels
without baths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you and I, Pussy,&#8221; said Shackleton, &#8220;seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
be the only two who&#8217;ve got any enthusiasm. You&#8217;ll
have to try and put some into Maud, and if the worst
comes to the worst we can kidnap the old lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was in an unusually good temper, and the dinner
was animated and merry. Only Maud, after the European
suggestion, grew more stolidly quiet than ever.
But she cheered herself by the thought that the spring
was six months off yet, and who could tell what might
happen in six months?</p>

<p>After dinner the ladies repaired to the music room,
and Shackleton, following a custom of his, passed
through one of the long windows into the garden, there
to pace up and down while he smoked his cigar.</p>

<p>The night was warm and odorous with the scent of
hidden blossoms. Now and then his foot crunched the
gravel of a path, as his walk took him back and forth
over the long stretch of lawn broken by flower-beds
and narrow walks. The great bulk of the house, its
black mass illumined by congeries of lit windows,
showed an inky, irregular outline against the star-strewn
sky.</p>

<p>Presently the sound of a piano floated out from the
music room. The man stopped his pacing, listened for
an instant, and then passed round to the side of the
house. The French windows of the music room were
opened, throwing elongated squares of light over the
balcony and the grass beyond. He paused in the darkness
and looked through one of them. There, like a
painting framed by the window casing, was Pussy
Thurston seated at the piano singing, while Maud sat
near by listening. One of Miss Thurston&#8217;s most admired
social graces was the gift of song. She had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
small agreeable voice, and had been well taught; but
the light, frail tones sounded thin in the wide silence
of the night. It was the feebly pretty performance of
the &#8220;accomplished young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shackleton listened with a slight smile that increased
as the song drew to a close. As it ceased he moved
away, the red light of his cigar coming and going in
the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Singing!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;they call that singing!
Wait till they hear my daughter!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the day when Mrs. Willers had appeared with
the news of Shackleton&#8217;s interest in her daughter,
Lucy&#8217;s health had steadily waned. The process of decay
was so quiet, albeit so sure and swift, that Mariposa,
accustomed to the ups and downs of her mother&#8217;s
invalid condition, was unaware that the elder woman&#8217;s
sands were almost run. The pale intensity, the coldness
of the hand gripped round hers, that had greeted
her account of the recital at the Opera-House, seemed
to the girl only the reflection of her own eager exultation.
She was blind, not only from ignorance, but
from the egotistic preoccupations of her youth. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
seemed impossible to think of her mother&#8217;s failing in
her loving response, now that the sun was rising on
their dark horizon.</p>

<p>But Lucy knew that she was dying. Her feeble body
had received its <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> on the day that Mrs.
Willers brought the news of Shackleton&#8217;s wish to see
his child. Since then she had spent long hours in
thought. When her mind was clear enough she had
pondered on the situation trying to see what was best
to do for Mariposa&#8217;s welfare. The problem that faced
her terrified her. The dying woman was having the
last struggle with herself.</p>

<p>One week after the recital at the Opera-House she
had grown so much worse that Mariposa had called
in the doctor they had had in attendance, off and on,
since their arrival. He was grave and there was a consultation.
When she saw their faces the cold dread
that had been slowly growing in the girl&#8217;s heart seemed
suddenly to expand and chill her whole being. Mrs.
Moreau was undoubtedly very ill, though there was
still hope. Yet their looks were sober and pitying as
they listened to the daughter&#8217;s reiterated asseverations
that her mother had often been worse and made a successful
rally.</p>

<p>An atmosphere of illness settled down like a fog on
the little cottage. A nurse appeared; the doctors
seemed to be in the house many times a day. Mrs.
Willers, as soon as she heard, came up, no longer over-dressed
and foolish, but grave and helpful. After a
half-hour spent at Lucy&#8217;s bedside, wherein the sick
woman had spoken little, and then only about her
daughter, Mrs. Willers had gone to the office of <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
Trumpet</i>, frowning in her sympathetic pain. It was
Saturday, and Shackleton had already left for Menlo
Park when she reached the office. But she determined
to see him early on Monday and tell him of the straits
of his old friend&#8217;s widow and child. Mrs. Willers
knew the signs of the scarcity of money, and knew also
the overwhelming expenses of sickness. What she did
not know was that on Friday morning Mariposa had
wept over her check-book, and then gone out and sold
the diamond brooch.</p>

<p>The long Sunday&mdash;the interminable day of strained
anxiety&mdash;passed, shrouded in rain. When her mother
fell into the light sleep that now marked her condition,
Mariposa mechanically went to the window of the bedroom
and looked out. It was one of those blinding
rains that usher in the San Francisco winter, the water
falling in straight lances that show against the light like
thin tubes of glass, and strike the pavement with a
vicious impact, which splinters them into spray. It
drummed on the tin roof above the bedroom with an
incessant hollow sound, and ran in a torn ribbon of
water from the gutter on the eaves.</p>

<p>The prospect that the window commanded seemed
in dreariness to match the girl&#8217;s thoughts. That part of
Pine Street was still in the unfinished condition described
by the words &#8220;far out.&#8221; Vacant lots yawned
between the houses; the badly paved roadbed was an
expanse of deeply rutted mud, with yellow ponds of
rain at the sewer mouths. The broken wooden sidewalk
gleamed with moisture and was evenly striped
with lines of vivid green where the grass sprouted between
the boards. Now and then a wayfarer hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
by, crouched under the dome of an umbrella spouting
water from every rib.</p>

<p>The gray twilight settled early, and Mariposa, dropping
the curtain, turned to the room behind her. The
light of a small fire and a shaded lamp sent a softened
glow over the apartment, which, despite its poverty, bespoke
the taste of gentlewomen in the simple prettiness
of its furnishings. The nurse, a middle-aged woman
of a kindly and capable aspect, sat by the fire in a
wicker rocking-chair, reading a paper. Beside her, on
a table, stood the sick-room paraphernalia of glasses
and bottles. The regular creak of the rocking-chair,
and an occasional snap from the fire, were the only
sounds that punctuated the steady drumming of the
rain on the tin roof.</p>

<p>A Japanese screen was half-way about the bed, shutting
it from the drafts of the door, and in its shelter
Lucy lay sleeping her light, breathless sleep. In this
shaded light, in the relaxed attitude of unconsciousness,
she presented the appearance of a young girl
hardly older than her daughter. Yet the hand of death
was plainly on her, as even Mariposa could now see.</p>

<p>Without sound the girl passed from the room to her
own beyond. Her grief had seized her, and the truth,
fought against with the desperate inexperience of
youth, forced itself on her. She threw herself on her
bed and lay there battling with the sickness of despair
that such knowledge brings. Twilight faded and darkness
came. In answer to the servant&#8217;s tap on the door,
and announcement of dinner, she called back that she
desired none. The room was as dark about her as her
own thoughts. From the door that led into the sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
chamber, only partly closed, a shaft of light cut the
blackness, and on this light she fastened her eyes,
swollen with tears, feeling herself stupefied with sorrow.</p>

<p>As she lay thus on the bed, she heard the creaking of
the wicker-chair as the nurse arose, then came the clink
of the spoon and the glass, and the woman&#8217;s low voice,
and then her mother&#8217;s, stronger and clearer than it had
been for some days. There was an interchange of remarks
between nurse and patient, the sound of careful
steps, and the crack of light suddenly expanded as the
door was opened. Against this background, clear and
smoothly yellow as gold leaf, the nurse&#8217;s figure was
revealed in sharp silhouette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, Miss Moreau?&#8221; she said in a low
voice. Mariposa started with a hurried reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, your mother wants to see you and you&#8217;d better
come. Her mind seems much clearer and it may
not be so again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl rose from the bed trying to compose her
face. In the light of the open door the woman saw its
distress and looked at her pityingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tire her,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I advise you to say
all you have to say. She may not be this way again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa crossed the room to the bed. Her mother
was lying on her side, pinched, pale and with darkly
circled eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you just waked up, darling?&#8221; said the girl,
tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, with a curious lack of response
in manner and tone; &#8220;I have been awake some time. I
was thinking.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you send Mrs. Brown for me? I was
in my room passing the time till you woke up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking and I wanted to finish. I have been
thinking a long time, days and weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa thought her mind was wandering, and sitting
down on a chair by the bedside, took her hand and
pressed it gently without speaking. Her mother lay
in the same attitude, her profile toward her, her eyes
looking vacantly at the screen. Suddenly she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know my old desk, the little rose-wood one
Dan gave me? Take my keys and open it, and in the
bottom you&#8217;ll see two envelopes, with no writing. One
looks dirty and old. Bring them to me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa rose wondering, and looking anxiously at
her mother. The elder woman saw the look, and said
weakly and almost peevishly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go; be quick. I am not strong enough to talk long.
The keys are in the work-box.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl obeyed as quickly as possible. The desk
was a small one resting on the center-table. It had
been a present of her father&#8217;s to her mother, and she
remembered it from her earliest childhood in a prominent
position in her mother&#8217;s room. She opened it,
and in a few moments, under old letters, memoranda
and souvenirs, found the two envelopes. Carrying
them to the bed she gave them to her mother.</p>

<p>Lucy took them with an unsteady hand, and for a
moment lay staring at her daughter and not moving.
Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the pillows under my head. It&#8217;s easier to
breathe when I&#8217;m higher,&#8221; and as Mariposa arranged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
them, she added, in a lower voice: &#8220;And tell Mrs.
Brown to go; I want to be alone with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa looked out beyond the screen, and seeing
the nurse still reading the paper, told her to go to the
kitchen and get her dinner. The woman rose with
alacrity, and asking Mariposa to call her if the invalid
showed signs of fatigue, or any change, left the room.</p>

<p>The girl turned back to the bedside and took the
chair. Lucy had taken from the dirty envelope a worn
and faded paper, which she slowly unfolded. As she
did so, she looked at her daughter with sunken eyes
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;These are my marriage certificates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa, again thinking that her mind was wandering,
tried to smile, and answered gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your marriage certificate, dear. You were only
married once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was married twice,&#8221; said Lucy, and handed the
girl the two papers.</p>

<p>Still supposing her mother slightly delirious, the
daughter took the papers and looked at them. The one
her eye first fell on was that of the original marriage.
She read the names without at first realizing whose
they were. Then the significance of the &#8220;Lucy Fraser&#8221;
came upon her. Her glance leaped to the second paper,
and at the first sweep of her eyes over it she saw it was
the marriage certificate of her father and mother,
Daniel Moreau and Lucy Fraser, dated at Placerville
twenty-five years before. She turned back to the other
paper, now more than bewildered. She held it near her
face, as though it were difficult to read, and in the dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
silence of the room it began to rustle with the trembling
of her hand. A fear of something hideous and overwhelming
seized her. With pale lips she read the
names, and the date, antedating by five years the other
certificate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; she cried, in a wild voice of inquiry, dropping
the paper on the bed.</p>

<p>Lucy, raised on her pillows, was looking at her with
a haggard intentness. All the vitality left in her expiring
body seemed concentrated in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was married twice,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how? When? What does it mean? Mother,
what does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was married twice,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;In St. Louis
to Jake Shackleton, and in Placerville, five years after,
to Dan Moreau. And I was never divorced from Jake.
It was not according to the law. I was never Dan&#8217;s
lawful wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl sat staring, the meaning of the words slowly
penetrating her brain. She was too stunned to speak.
Her face was as white as her mother&#8217;s. For a tragic
moment these two white faces looked at each other.
The mother&#8217;s, with death waiting to claim her, was
void of all stress or emotion. The daughter&#8217;s, waking
to life, was rigid with horrified amaze.</p>

<p>Propped by her pillows, Lucy spoke again; her sentences
were short and with pauses between:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake Shackleton married me in St. Louis when I
was fifteen. He was soon tired of me. We went to
Salt Lake City. He became a Mormon there, and took
a second wife. She was a waitress in a hotel. She&#8217;s
his wife now. He brought us both to California twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
years ago. On the way across, on the plains of
Utah, you were born. He is your father, Mariposa.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made an effort and sat up. Her breathing was
becoming difficult, but her purpose gave her strength.
This was the information that for weeks she had been
nerving herself to impart.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is your father,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I
wanted to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa made no answer, and again she repeated:</p>

<p>&#8220;He is your father. Do you understand? Answer
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. Oh, mother, it&#8217;s so strange
and horrible. And you sitting there and looking at me
like that, and telling it to me! Oh,&mdash;mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her hands over her face for an instant, and
then dropping them, leaned over on the bed and
grasped her mother&#8217;s wrists.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wandering in your mind. It&#8217;s just some hideous
dream you&#8217;ve had in your fever. Dearest, tell me
it&#8217;s not true. It can&#8217;t be true. Why, think of you and
me and father always together and with no dreadful
secret behind us like that. Oh&mdash;it can&#8217;t be true!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy looked at the papers lying brown and torn on
the white quilt. Mariposa&#8217;s eyes followed the same
direction, and with a groan her head sank on her arms
extended along the bed. Her mother&#8217;s hand, cold and
light, was laid on one of hers, but the dying woman&#8217;s
face was held in its quiet, unstirred apathy, as she
spoke again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake was hard to me on the trip. He was a hard
man and he never loved me. After Bessie came he got
to dislike me. I was always a drag, he said. I couldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
seem to get well after you were born. Coming over the
Sierras we stopped at a cabin. Dan was there with
another man, a miner, called Fletcher. That was the
first time I ever saw Dan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa lifted her head and her eyes fastened on
her mother&#8217;s face. The indifference that had held it
seemed breaking. A faint smile was on her lips, a light
of reminiscence lit its gray pallor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was always good to anything that was sick or
weak. He was sorry for me. He tried to make Jake
stop longer, so I could get rested. But Jake wouldn&#8217;t.
He said I had to go on. I couldn&#8217;t, but knew I must,
if he said it. We were going to start when Jake said
he&#8217;d exchange me for the pair of horses the two miners
had in the shed. So he left me and took the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exchanged you for the horses? Left you there sick
and alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jake and Bessie went on with the horses. I
stayed. I was too sick to care.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a slight pause, either from weakness, or in
an effort to arrange the next part of her story.</p>

<p>&#8220;I lived there with them for a month. I was sick
and they took care of me. Then one day Fletcher
stole all the money and the only horse and never came
back. We were alone there then, Dan and I. I got
better. I came to love him more each day. We were
snowed in all winter, and we lived as man and wife. In
the spring we rode into Hangtown and were married.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, a look of ineffable sweetness passed
over her face, and she said in a low voice, as if speaking
to herself:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Oh, that beautiful winter! There is a God, to be so
good to women who have suffered as I had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa sat dumbly regarding her. It was like a
frightful nightmare. Everything was strange, the sick-room,
the bed with the screen around it, her mother&#8217;s
face with its hollow eyes and pinched nose. Only the
two old dirty papers on the white counterpane seemed
to say that this was real.</p>

<p>Lucy&#8217;s eyes, which had been looking back into that
glorified past of love and youth, returned to her daughter&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jake is your father,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I
had to tell you. He&#8217;ll be good to you. That was why
he wanted to find you and help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mariposa, dully, &#8220;I understand that
now; that was why he wanted to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be good to you,&#8221; went on the low, weak voice,
interrupted by quick breaths. &#8220;I know Jake. He&#8217;ll be
proud of you. You&#8217;re handsome and talented, not
weak and poor spirited, as I was. You&#8217;re his only legitimate
child; the others are not; they were born in California.
They&#8217;re Bessie&#8217;s children, and I was his only
real wife. You&#8217;ll let him take care of you? Oh, Mariposa,
my darling, I&#8217;ve told you all this that you might
understand and let him take care of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a last call on her strength and leaned forward.
Her dying body was re-vivified; all her mother&#8217;s
agony of love appeared on her face. In determining
to destroy the illusions of her child to secure her
future, she had made the one heroic effort of her life.
It was done, and for a last moment of relief and triumph
she was thrillingly alive.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Mariposa, in a spasm of despair, threw herself forward
on the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why did you tell me? Why did you tell me?&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you let me think it was the way
it used to be? Why did you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lucy laid her hand on the bowed head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I wanted you to understand and let him be
your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father! That man! Oh, no, no!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must promise me. Oh, my beloved child, I
couldn&#8217;t leave you alone. It seemed as if God had said
to me, &#8216;Die in peace. Her father will care for her.&#8217; I
couldn&#8217;t go and leave you this way, without a friend.
Now I can rest in peace. Promise to let him take care
of you. Promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother, don&#8217;t ask me. What have you just told
me? That he sold you to a stranger for a pair of
horses, left you to die in a cabin in the mountains!
That&#8217;s not my father. My father was Dan Moreau. I
can do nothing but hate that other man now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame him, dear, the past is over. Forgive
him. Forgive me. If I sinned there were excuses for
me. I had suffered too much. I loved too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice suddenly hesitated and broke. A gray
pallor ran over her face and a look of terror transfixed
her eyes. She straightened her arms out toward her
daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise,&#8221; she gasped, &#8220;promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a spring Mariposa snatched the drooping body
in her arms and cried into the face, settling into cold
rigidity:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I promise! All&mdash;anything. Oh, mother,
darling, look at me. I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gently shook the limp form, but it was nerveless,
only the head oscillated slightly from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, look at me,&#8221; she cried frantically. &#8220;Look
at me, not past me. Come back to me. Speak to me, I
promise everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was no response. Lucy lay, limp and
white-lipped, her head lolling back from the support of
her daughter&#8217;s arm. Her strength was exhausted to
the last drop. She was unconscious.</p>

<p>The wild figure of Mariposa at the kitchen door summoned
Mrs. Brown. Lucy was not dead, but dying.
A few moments later Mariposa found herself rushing
hatless through the rain for the doctor, and then again,
in what seemed a few more minutes, standing, soaked
and breathless, by her mother&#8217;s side. She sat there
throughout the night, holding the limp hand and
watching for a glimmer of consciousness in the half-shut
eyes.</p>

<p>It never came. There was no rally from the collapse
which followed the mother&#8217;s confession. She had lived
till this was done. Then, having accomplished the
great action of her life, she had loosed her hold and let
go. Once, Mrs. Brown being absent, Mariposa had
leaned down on the pillow and passionately reiterated
the assurance that she would give the promise Lucy
had asked. There was a slight quiver of animation in
the dying woman&#8217;s face and she opened her eyes as if
startled, but made no other sign of having heard or understood.
But Mariposa knew that she had promised.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>On the evening of the day after her confession Lucy
died, slipping away quietly as if in sleep. The death
of the simple and unknown lady made no ripple on the
surface of the city&#8217;s life. Mrs. Willers and a neighbor
or two were Mariposa&#8217;s sole visitors, and the only
flowers contributed to Lucy&#8217;s coffin were those sent by
the newspaper woman and Barry Essex. The afternoon
of the day on which her mother&#8217;s death was announced,
Mariposa received a package from Jake
Shackleton. With it came a short note of condolence,
and the offer, kindly and simply worded, of the small
sum of money contained in the package, which, it was
hoped, Miss Moreau, for the sake of the writer&#8217;s early
acquaintance with her parents and interest in herself,
would accept. The packet contained five hundred dollars
in coin.</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s face flamed. The money fell through her
fingers and rolled about on the floor. She would have
liked to take it, piece by piece, and throw it through
the window, into the mud of the street. She felt that
her horror of Shackleton augmented with every passing
moment, gripped her deeper with every memory of
her mother&#8217;s words, and every moment&#8217;s perusal of the
calm, dead face in its surrounding flowers.</p>

<p>But her promise had been given. She picked up the
money and put it away. Her promise had been given.
Already she was beginning dimly to realize that it
would bind and cramp her for the rest of her life. She
was too benumbed now fully to grasp its meaning, but
she felt feebly that she would be its slave as long as he
or she lived. But she had given it.</p>

<p>The money lay untouched throughout the next few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
days, Lucy&#8217;s simple funeral ceremonies being paid for
with the proceeds of the sale of the diamond brooch,
which Moreau had given her in the early days of their
happiness.</p>

<p>Jake Shackleton did not come up from San Mateo on
Monday, as Mrs. Willers expected, and the first intimation
he had of Lucy&#8217;s death was the short notice in
the paper.</p>

<p>He had come down the stairs early on Tuesday
morning into the wide hall, with its doors thrown open
to the fragrant air. With the paper in his hand, he
stood on the balcony looking about and inhaling the
freshness of the morning. The rain had washed the
country clean of every fleck of dust, burnished every
leaf, and had called into being blossoms that had been
awaiting its summons.</p>

<p>From beneath the shade made by the long, gnarled
limbs of the live-oaks, the perfume of the violets rose
delicately, their crowding clusters of leaves a clear
green against the base of the hoary trunks. The air
that drifted in from the idle, yellow fields beyond was
impregnated with the breath of the tar-weed&mdash;one of
the most pungent and impassioned odors Nature has
manufactured in her vast laboratory, characteristic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
scent to rise from the dry, yet fecund grass-lands of
California. In the perfect, crystalline stillness these
mingled perfumes rose like incense to the new day.</p>

<p>Shackleton looked about him, the paper in his hand.
He had little love for Nature, but the tranquil-scented
freshness of the hour wrung its tribute of admiration
from him. What an irony that the one child he had,
worth having gained all this for, should be denied it.
Mariposa, thus framed, would have added the last
touch to the triumphs of his life.</p>

<p>With an exclamation of impatience he sat down on
the top step, and opening the paper, ran his glance
down its columns. He had been looking over it for
several minutes before the death notice of Lucy struck
his eye. It took away his breath. He read it again, at
first not crediting it. He was entirely unprepared,
having merely thought of Lucy as &#8220;delicate.&#8221; Now she
was dead.</p>

<p>He dropped the paper on his knee and sat staring out
into the garden. The news was more of a shock than
he could have imagined it would be. Was it the lately
roused pride in his child that had reawakened some
old tenderness for the mother? Or was it that the
thought of Lucy, dead, called back memories of that
shameful past?</p>

<p>He sat, staring, till a step on the balcony roused him,
and turning, he saw his son. Win, though only twenty-three,
was of the order of beings who do not look
well in the morning. He was slightly built and thin
and had a rasped, pink appearance, as though he felt
cold. Stories were abroad that Win was dissipated,
stories, by the way, that were largely manufactured by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
himself. He was at that age when a reputation for
deviltry has its attractions. In fact, he was amiable,
gentle and far too lacking in spirit to be the desperate
rake he liked to represent himself. He had a wholesome
fear of his father, whose impatience against him
was not concealed by surface politeness as in Maud&#8217;s
case.</p>

<p>Standing with his hands in his trousers&#8217; pockets, his
chest hollowed, his red-rimmed eyes half shut behind
the <i>pince-nez</i> he always wore, and his slight mustache
not sufficient to hide a smile, the foolishness of which
rose from embarrassment, he was not a son to fill a
father&#8217;s heart with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Howdy, Governor,&#8221; he said, trying to be easy; then,
seeing the paper in his father&#8217;s hand, folded back at the
death notices, &#8220;anybody new born, dead, or married
this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice rasped unbearably on his father&#8217;s mood.
The older man gave him a look over his shoulder, with
a face that made the boy quail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get away,&#8221; he said, savagely; &#8220;get in the house and
leave me alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Win turned and entered the house. The foolish smile
was still on his lips. Pride kept it there, but at heart
he was bitterly wounded.</p>

<p>At the foot of the stairway he met his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not go out there,&#8221; he said, with a
movement of his head in the direction of his father;
&#8220;it&#8217;s as much as your life&#8217;s worth. The old man&#8217;ll bite
your nose off if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your father cross?&#8221; asked Bessie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>&#8220;Cross? He oughtn&#8217;t to be let loose when he&#8217;s like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something in the paper must have upset him,&#8221; said
Bessie. &#8220;He was all right this morning before he came
down. Something on the stock market&#8217;s bothered
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so,&#8221; said his son, with a certain feeling.
&#8220;But that&#8217;s no reason why he should speak to me like a
dog. He goes too far when he speaks to me that way.
There isn&#8217;t a servant in the house would stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He balanced back and forth on his toes and heels,
looking down, his face flushed. It would have been
hard to say&mdash;such was the characterless insignificance
of his appearance&mdash;whether he was really hurt, as a
man would be in his heart and his pride, or only momentarily
stung by a scornful word.</p>

<p>Bessie passed him and went out on the balcony. Her
husband was still sitting on the steps, the paper in his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Jake?&#8221; she said. &#8220;Win says you&#8217;re
cross. Something gone wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucy&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he answered, rising to his feet and
handing her the paper.</p>

<p>She paled a little as she read the notice. Then, raising
her eyes, they met his. In this look was their
knowledge of the secret that both had struggled to
keep, and that now, at last, was theirs.</p>

<p>For the second time in a half-year, Death had
stepped in and claimed one of the four whose lives
had touched so briefly and so momentously twenty-five
years before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;Poor Lucy!&#8221; said Bessie, in a low voice. &#8220;But they
say she was very happy with Moreau. You can do
something for your&mdash;for the girl now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over. I won&#8217;t be down
to breakfast. Send up some coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went upstairs and locked himself in his library.
He could not understand why the news had affected
him so deeply. It seemed to make him feel sick. He
did not tell Bessie that he had gone upstairs because
he felt too ill and shaken to see any one.</p>

<p>All morning he sat in the library, with frowning
brows, thinking. At noon he took the train for the
city and, soon after its arrival, despatched to Mariposa
the five hundred dollars. He had no doubt of her
accepting it, as it never crossed his mind that Lucy, at
the last moment, might have told.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The days that followed her mother&#8217;s funeral passed
to Mariposa like a series of gray dreams, dreadful,
with an unfamiliar sense of wretchedness. The preoccupation
of her mother&#8217;s illness was gone. There were
idle hours, when she sat in her rooms and tried to realize
the full meaning of Lucy&#8217;s last words. She would
sit motionless, staring before her, her heart feeling
shriveled in her breast. Her life seemed broken to
pieces. She shrank from the future, with the impossibilities
she had pledged herself to. And the strength
and inspiration of the beautiful past were gone. All
the memories of that happy childhood and young
maidenhood were blasted. It was natural that the
shock and the subsequent brooding should make her
view of the subject morbid. The father that she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
grown up to regard with reverential tenderness, had
not been hers. The mother, who had been a cherished
idol, had hidden a dark secret. And she, herself, was
an outsider from the home she had so deeply loved&mdash;child
of a brutal and tyrannical father&mdash;originally
adopted and cared for out of pity.</p>

<p>It was a crucial period in her life. Old ideals were
gone, and new ones not yet formed. There seemed
only ruins about her, and amid these she sought for
something to cling to, and believe in. With secret passion
she nursed the thought of Essex&mdash;all she had left
that had not been swept away in the deluge of this
past week.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her, the business calls of the life of
a woman left penniless shook her from her state of
brooding idleness. The cottage was hers for a month
longer, and despite the impoverished condition of the
widow, there was a fair amount of furniture still left
in it that was sufficiently valuable to be a bait to the
larger dealers. Mariposa found her days varied by
contentions with men, who came to stare at the great
red lacquer cabinet and investigate the interior condition
of the marquetry sideboard. When the month
was up she was to move to a small boarding-house,
kept by Spaniards called Garcia, that Mrs. Willers, in
her varying course, included among her habitats. The
Garcias would not object to her piano and practising,
and it was amazingly cheap. Mrs. Willers herself had
lived there in one of her periods of eclipse, and knew
them to be respectable denizens of a somewhat battered
Bohemia.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re going to be a Bohemian yourself, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
a musical genius,&#8221; she said cheerfully. &#8220;So you won&#8217;t
mind that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa did not think she would mind. In the
chaotic dimness of the dismantled front parlor she
looked like a listless goddess who would not mind
anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers thought her state of dreary apathy
curious and spoke of it to Shackleton, whom she now
recognized as the girl&#8217;s acknowledged guardian. He
had listened to her account of Mariposa&#8217;s broken condition
with expressionless attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it natural, all things considered, that a girl
should be broken-hearted over the death of a devoted
mother? And, as I understand it, Miss Moreau is
absolutely alone. She has no relatives anywhere. It&#8217;s
a pretty bleak outlook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. I never saw a girl left so without
connections. But she worries me. She&#8217;s so silent, and
dull, and unlike herself. Of course, it&#8217;s been a terrible
blow. I&#8217;d have thought she&#8217;d been more prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, stroking his short beard
with his lean, heavily-veined hand. It amused him to
see the way Mrs. Willers was quietly pushing him into
the position of the girl&#8217;s sponsor. And at the same
time it heightened his opinion of her as a woman of
capacity and heart. She would be an ideal chaperone
and companion for his unprotected daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;When she feels better,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wish you&#8217;d
bring her down here again. Don&#8217;t bother her until
she feels equal to it. But I want to talk to her about
Lepine&#8217;s ideas for her. I saw him again and he gave
me a lot of information about Paris and teachers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
all the rest of it. Before we make any definite arrangements
I&#8217;ll have to see her and talk it all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers went back triumphant to Mariposa to
report this conversation. It really seemed to clinch
matters. The Bonanza King had instituted himself
her guardian and backer. It meant fortune for Mariposa
Moreau, the penniless orphan.</p>

<p>To her intense surprise, Mariposa listened to her
with a flushed and frowning face of indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; she said, with sudden violence.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear!&#8221; expostulated Mrs. Willers, &#8220;your
whole future depends on it. With such an influence
to back you as that, your fortune&#8217;s made. And listen
to me, honey, for I know,&mdash;it&#8217;s not an easy job for a
woman to get on who&#8217;s alone and as good-looking as
you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; repeated Mariposa, angry and obstinate.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not, for goodness&#8217; sake?&#8221;&mdash;in blank amaze.
&#8220;What&#8217;s come over you? Is it your mourning? You
know your mother&#8217;s the last person who&#8217;d want you to
sit indoors, moping like a snail in a shell, when your
future was waiting for you outside the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her promise rose up before Mariposa&#8217;s mental vision
and checked the angry reiteration that was on her lips.
She turned away, suddenly, tremulous and pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about it any more,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but
I <i>can&#8217;t</i> go now. Perhaps later on, but not now&mdash;I can&#8217;t
go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers shrugged her shoulders, and was wisely
silent. Mariposa&#8217;s grief was making her unreasonable,
that was all. To Shackleton she merely said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the girl was too ill and overwrought to see any one
just yet. As soon as she was herself again Mrs. Willers
would bring her to <i>The Trumpet</i> office for the interview
that was to be the opening of the new era.</p>

<p>The month of Mariposa&#8217;s tenantry of the cottage
was up. It was the last evening there, and she sat
crouched over a handful of fire that burned in the
front parlor grate. The room was half empty, all the
superfluous furniture having been taken that morning
by a Jewish second-hand dealer. In one corner stood
huddled such relics as she had chosen to keep, and
which would be borne away on the morrow to the
Garcias&#8217; boarding-house. The marquetry sideboard
was gone. It had been sold to a Sutter Street dealer
for twenty-five dollars. The red lacquer cabinet, though
no longer hers, still remained. It, too, would be carried
away to-morrow morning by its new owners. She
looked at it with melancholy glances as the firelight
found and lost its golden traceries and sent sudden
quivering gleams along its scarlet doors. The fire was
less a luxury than an economy, to burn the last pieces
of coal in the bin.</p>

<p>Bending over the dancing flames, Mariposa held her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
hands open to the blaze, absently looking at their backs.
They were fine, capable hands, large and white, with
strong wrists and a forearm so round that its swell
began half-way between elbow and wrist-bone. Pleased
by the warmth that soothed the chill always induced
by a sojourn in the front parlor, she pulled up her
sleeves and watched the gleam of the fire turn the
white skin red. She was sitting thus, when a ring at
the bell made her start and hurriedly push her sleeves
down. Her visitors were so few that she was almost
certain of the identity of this one. For all the griefs
of the last month she was yet a woman. She sprang
to her feet, and as the steps of the servant sounded in
the hall, ran to the large mirror in the corner and
patted and pulled her hair to the style she thought most
becoming.</p>

<p>She had turned from this and was standing by the
fire when Essex entered. He had seen her once since
her mother&#8217;s death, but she had then been so preoccupied
with grief that, with a selfish man&#8217;s hatred
of all unpleasant things, he had left her as soon as
possible. To-night he saw that she was recovering,
that, physically at least, she was herself again. But
he was struck, almost as soon as his eye fell on her, by
a change in her. Some influence had been at work to
effect a subtile and curious development in her. The
simplicity, the something childish and winning that
had always seemed so inconsistent with her stately appearance,
was gone. Mariposa was coming to herself.
His heart quickened its beats as he realized she was
handsomer, richer by some inward growth, more a
woman than she had been a month ago.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>He took a seat at the other side of the fire, and the
tentative conversation of commonplaces occupied them
for a few moments. The silence that had held her in
a spell of dead dejection on his former visit was
broken. She seemed more than usually talkative. In
fact, Mariposa was beginning to feel the reaction from
the life of grief and seclusion of the last month. She
was violently ashamed of the sense of elation that had
surged up in her at the sound of Essex&#8217;s voice. She
struggled to hide it, but it lit a light in her eyes, called
a color to her cheeks that she could not conceal. The
presence of her lover affected her with a sort of embarrassed
exultation that she had never experienced
before. To hide it she talked rapidly, looking into the
fire, to which she still held out her hands.</p>

<p>Essex, from the other side of the hearth, watched
her. He saw his arrival had made her nervous, and
it only augmented the sentiment that had been growing
in him for months.</p>

<p>She began to tell him of her move.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to-morrow, in the afternoon. It&#8217;s a
queer place, an old house on Hyde Street, with a big
pepper-tree, the biggest in the city, they say, growing
in the front garden. It was once quite a fine house,
long ago in the early days, and was built by these
people, the Garcias, when they still had money. Then
they lost it all, and now the old lady and her son&#8217;s
wife take a few people, as the house is too big for them
and they are so poor. Young Mrs. Garcia is a widow.
Her husband was killed in the mines by a blast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds picturesque. Do they speak English?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>&#8220;The se&ntilde;ora, that&#8217;s the old lady, doesn&#8217;t. She has
lived here since before the Gringo came, but she can&#8217;t
speak any English at all. The daughter-in-law is an
American, a Southerner. She looked very untidy the
day I went there. I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll be homesick. You&#8217;ll
come to see me sometimes, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no coquetry in the remark. Her dread of
loneliness was all that spoke.</p>

<p>Essex met her eyes, dark and wistful, and nodded
without speaking.</p>

<p>She looked back at the fire and again spread her
hands to it, palms out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;rather a dilapidated sort of place,&#8221; she
continued after a moment&#8217;s pause, &#8220;but perhaps I&#8217;ll
get used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was distinct pleading for confirmation in this.
Her voice was slightly husky. Essex, however, with
that perversity which marked all his treatment of her,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you will? It&#8217;s difficult for a woman
to accommodate herself to such changed conditions&mdash;I
mean a woman of refinement, like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She continued feebly to make her stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But my conditions have changed so much in the last
two or three years. I ought to be used to it; it&#8217;s not
as if it was the first time. Before my father got sick
we were so comfortable. We were rich and had quantities
of beautiful things like that cabinet. And as they
have gone, one by one, so we have come down bit by
bit, till I am left like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a gesture to include the empty room and
turned back to the fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t stay like this,&#8221; he said, throwing a
glance over the bare walls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221; she said, looking into the
fire with dejected eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;re kind to try to cheer
me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be happy, protected and cared for, with
your life full of sunshine and joy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped. Every step he took was of moment,
and he was not the type of man to forgive himself a
mistake. Mariposa was looking at him, frowning
slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; she said. &#8220;With my voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, in a tone that suddenly thrilled
with meaning, &#8220;with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>That quivering pause which falls between a man and
woman when the words that will link or sever them for
life are to be spoken, held the room. Mariposa felt
the terrified desire to arrest the coming words that is
the maiden&#8217;s last instinctive stand for her liberty. But
her brain was confused, and her heart beat like a hammer.</p>

<p>&#8220;With me,&#8221; Essex repeated, as the pause grew unbearable.
&#8220;Is there no happiness for you in that
thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer, and suddenly he moved his
chair close to her side. She felt his eyes fastened on
her and kept hers on the fire. Her other offers of marriage
had not been accomplished with this stifling
sense of discomfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought,&#8221; his deep voice went on, &#8220;that you
cared for me&mdash;a little. I&#8217;ve watched, I&#8217;ve desponded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
But lately&mdash;lately&mdash;&#8221; he leaned toward her and lowered
his voice&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve hoped.&#8221;</p>

<p>She still made no answer. It seemed to her none
was necessary or possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you care?&#8221; he said softly.</p>

<p>She breathed a &#8220;yes&#8221; that only the ear of love could
have heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa, dearest, do you mean it?&#8221; He leaned
over her and laid his hand on hers. His voice was
husky and his hand trembling. To the extent that
was in him he loved this woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love me?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>The &#8220;yes&#8221; was even fainter this time. He raised the
hand he held to his breast and tried to draw her into
his arms.</p>

<p>She resisted, and turned on him a pale face, where
emotions, never stirred before, were quivering. She
was moved to the bottom of her soul. Something in
her face made him shrink a little. With her hand
against his breast she gave him the beautiful look of
a woman&#8217;s first sense of her surrender. He stifled the
sudden twinge of his conscience and again tried to
draw her close to him. But she held him off with the
hand on his breast and said&mdash;as thousands of girls say
every year:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than the whole world,&#8221; he answered glibly,
but with the roughened voice of real feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she said with a tremulous smile, &#8220;why
should you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you are you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;But I&#8217;m just a small insignificant person here,
without any relations, and poor, so poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those things don&#8217;t matter when a man loves a
woman. It&#8217;s you I want, not anything you might have
or might be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re so clever and have lived everywhere
and seen everything, and I&#8217;m so&mdash;so countrified and
stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Mariposa. That&#8217;s enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I can bring you for my portion is my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s all I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me enough to marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes that had been looking ardently into her face,
shifted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you enough to be a fool about you. Does
that please you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her murmured answer was lost in the first kiss of
love that had ever been pressed on her lips. She drew
back from it, pale and thrilled, not abashed, but looking
at her lover with eyes before which his drooped.
It was a sacred moment to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;How wonderful,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;that you should
care for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been more wonderful if I hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that you came now, when everything was so
dark and lonely. You don&#8217;t know how horribly lonely
I felt this evening, thinking of leaving here to-morrow
and going among strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s all over now. You need never be lonely
again. I&#8217;ll always be there to take care of you. We&#8217;ll
always be together.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think things often change when they get
to their very worst? It seemed to me to-night that I
was just about to open a door that led into the world,
where nobody cared for me, or knew me, or wanted
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One person wanted you, desperately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, all in a moment, my whole life is changed.
It&#8217;s not an hour ago that I was sitting here looking
into the fire thinking how miserable I was, and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in my arms!&#8221; he interrupted, and drew
her against him for his kiss. She turned her face
away and pressed it into his shoulder, as he held her
close, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to Europe, to Italy&mdash;that&#8217;s the country for
you, not this raw Western town where you&#8217;re like some
exotic blossom growing in the sand. You&#8217;ve never seen
anything like it, with the gray olive trees like smoke
on the hillsides, and the white walls of the villas
shining among the cypresses. We&#8217;ll have a villa, and
we can walk on the terrace in the evening and look
down on the valley of the Arno. It&#8217;s the place for
lovers, and we&#8217;re going to be lovers, Mariposa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still she did not understand, and said happily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, true lovers for always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then we&#8217;ll go to France, and we&#8217;ll see Paris&mdash;all
the great squares with the lights twinkling, and
the Rue de Rivoli with gas lamps strung along it like
diamonds on a thread. And the river&mdash;it&#8217;s black at
night with the bridges arching over it, and the lamps
stabbing down into the water with long golden zigzags.
We&#8217;ll go to the theaters and to the opera, and you&#8217;ll
be the handsomest woman there. And we&#8217;ll drive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
home in an open carriage under the starlight, not saying
much, because we&#8217;ll be so happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And shall I study singing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, with the best masters. You&#8217;ll be a great
prima donna some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shan&#8217;t have to be sent by Mr. Shackleton?
Oh, I shall be so glad to tell him I&#8217;m going with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex started&mdash;looked at her frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he said with a sudden,
authoritative change of key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You know he was to
send me. I promised my mother I would let him take
care of me. But now that I&#8217;m going to be married,
my&mdash;my&mdash;husband will take care of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a girl&#8217;s charming embarrassment
at the first fitting of this word to any breathing
man, and blushed deeply and beautifully. Essex felt
he must disillusion her. He looked into the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Married,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;Well, of course, if we
were married&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, gave her a lightning side glance. She
was smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course we&#8217;ll be married,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How
could we go to Europe unless we were?&#8221;</p>

<p>Still avoiding her eyes, which he knew were fixed
on him in smiling inquiry, he said in a lowered voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time there was a faint note of uneasiness
in her voice. Though his glance was still bent on the
fire, he knew that she was no longer smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could go easily, without making any talk or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
fuss. Of course we could not leave here together.
I&#8217;d meet you in Chicago or New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard her dress rustle as she instinctively drew
away from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet me in New York or Chicago?&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;But why meet me there? I don&#8217;t understand. Why
not be married here?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned toward her and threw up his head as a
person does who is going to speak emphatically and at
length. Only in raising his head his eyes remained on
the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear girl,&#8221; he said in a suave tone, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
lived all your life in these small, half-civilized California
towns, and there are many things about life
in larger and more advanced communities you don&#8217;t
understand. I&#8217;ve just told you I loved you, and you
know that your welfare is of more moment to me than
anything in the world. I would give my heart&#8217;s blood
to make you happy. But I am just now hardly in a
position to marry. You must understand that.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was said. Mariposa gave a low exclamation and
rose to her feet. He rose, too, feeling angry with
her that she had forced him to this banal explanation.
There were times when her stupidity could be exasperating.</p>

<p>She was very pale, her eyes dark, her nostrils expanded.
On her face was an expression of pitiful bewilderment
and distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then&mdash;you didn&#8217;t want to <i>marry</i> me?&#8221; she
stammered with trembling lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I want to,&#8221; he said with a propitiatory shrug.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
&#8220;Of course I <i>want</i> to. But one can&#8217;t always do what
one wants. Under the circumstances, as I tell you,
marriage is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could say nothing for a moment, the first
stunned moment of comprehension. Then she said in
a low voice, still with her senses scattered, &#8220;And I
thought you meant it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meant what? that I love you? Don&#8217;t you trust me?
Don&#8217;t you believe me? You must acknowledge I understand
life better than you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him straight in the eyes. The pain
and bewilderment had left her face, leaving it white
and tense. He realized that she was not going to
weep and make moan&mdash;the wound had gone deeper.
He had stabbed her to the heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand about
life as you do. I didn&#8217;t understand that a man could
talk to a woman as you have done to me and then
strike her such a blow. It&#8217;s too new to me to learn
quickly. I&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t&mdash;understand yet. I can&#8217;t say
anything to you, only that I don&#8217;t ever want to see
you, or hear you, or think of you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest girl,&#8221; he said, going a step toward her,
&#8220;don&#8217;t be so severe. You&#8217;re like a tragedy queen.
Now, what have I done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think that a man could have the heart
to wound any woman so&mdash;any living creature, and one
who cared as I did&mdash;&#8221; she stopped, unable to continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t wound you for the world. Haven&#8217;t
I just told you I loved you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go,&#8221; she said, backing away from him. &#8220;Go!
go away. Never come near me again. You&#8217;ve debased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
and humiliated me forever, and I&#8217;ve kissed you
and told you I loved you. Why can&#8217;t I creep into
some corner and die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa, my darling,&#8221; he said, raising his eyebrows
with a theatrical air of incomprehension, &#8220;what
is it? I&#8217;m quite at sea. You speak to me as if I&#8217;d
done you a wrong, and all I&#8217;ve done is to offer you my
deepest devotion. Does that offend you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, horribly&mdash;horribly!&#8221; she cried furiously. &#8220;Go&mdash;go
out of my sight. If you&#8217;ve got any manliness or
decency left, go&mdash;I can&#8217;t bear any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her hands on her face and turned from
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; he said tenderly, approaching
her. &#8220;Does my love make you unhappy? A half-hour
ago it was not like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suddenly, but gently, attempted to take her in
his arms. Though she did not see she felt his touch,
and with a cry of horror tore herself away, rushed
past him into the adjoining room, and from that into
her bedroom beyond. The bang of the closing door
fell coldly upon Essex&#8217;s ear.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment listening and considering.
He had a fancy that she might come back. The house
was absolutely silent. Then, no sound breaking its
stillness, no creak of an opening door echoing through
its bare emptiness, he walked out into the hall, put
on his hat and overcoat and let himself out. He was
angry and disgusted. In his thoughts he inveighed
against Mariposa&#8217;s stupidity. The unfortunately downright
explanation had aroused her wrath, and he did
not know how deep that might be. Only as he recalled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
her ordering him from the room he realized that it was
not the fictitious rage he had seen before and understood.</p>

<p>Mariposa stood on the inside of her room door, holding
the knob and trying to suppress her breathing that
she might hear clearly. She heard his steps, echoing
on the bare floor with curious distinctness. They were
slow at first; then there was decision in them; then the
hall door banged. She leaned against the panel, her
teeth pressed on her underlip, her head bowed on her
breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how could he? how could he?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>A tempest of anguish shook her. She crept to the
bed and lay there, her face buried in the pillow, motionless
and dry-eyed, till dawn.</p>

<p>The day broke overcast and damp, one of those depressing
days of still, soft grayness that usher in the
early rains, when the air has a heavy closeness and the
skies seem to sag with the weight of moisture that is
slow to fall.</p>

<p>There was much to do yet in the rifled cottage.
Mariposa rose to it wan and heavy-eyed. The whirl
of her own thoughts during the long, sleepless night
had not soothed her shame and distress. She found
herself working doggedly, with her heart like lead in
her breast, and her mouth feeling dry as the scene of
the evening before pressed forward to her attention.
She tried to keep it in the background, but it would not
down. Words, looks, sentences kept welling up to the
surface of her mind, coloring her cheeks with a miserable
crimson, filling her being with a sickness of despair.
The memory of the kisses followed her from
room to room, and task to task. She felt them on her
lips as she moved about, the lips that had never known
the kiss of a lover, and now seemed soiled and smirched
forever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>After luncheon the red lacquer cabinet went away.
She watched it off as the last remnant of the old life.
She felt strangely indifferent to what yesterday she
thought would be so many unbearable wrenches.
Finally nothing was left but her own few possessions,
gathered together in a corner of the front room&mdash;two
trunks, a screen, a table, a long, old-fashioned mirror
and some pictures. Yesterday morning she had bargained
with a cheap carter, picked up on the street
corner, to take them for a dollar, and now she sat waiting
for him, while the day grew duller outside, and
the fog began to sift itself into fine rain.</p>

<p>The servant, who was to close and lock the cottage,
begged her to go, promising to see to the shipping of
the last load. Mariposa needed no special urging. She
felt that an afternoon spent in that dim little parlor,
looking out through the bay window at the fine slant
of the rain would drive her mad. There was no promise
of cheer at the Garcia boarding-house, but it was,
at least, not haunted with memories.</p>

<p>A half-hour later, with the precious desk, containing
the marriage certificates and Shackleton&#8217;s gift of
money, under her arm, she was climbing the hills from
Sutter Street to that part of Hyde Street in which the
Garcia house stood. She eyed it with deepening gloom
as it revealed itself through the thin rain. It was a
house which even then was getting old, standing back
from the street on top of a bank, which was held in
place by a wooden bulk-head, surmounted by a low
balustrade. A gate gave access through this, and a
flight of rotting wooden steps led by zigzags to the
house. The lower story was skirted in front by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
balcony, which, after the fashion of early San Francisco
architecture, was encased in glass. Its roof
above slanted up to the two long windows of the front
bedroom. The pepper-tree, of which Mariposa had
spoken to Essex, was sufficient to tell of the age of the
property and to give beauty and picturesqueness to the
ramshackle old place. It had reached an unusual
growth and threw a fountain of drooping foliage over
the balustrade and one long limb upon the balcony roof.</p>

<p>To-day it dripped with the rest of the world. As
Mariposa let the gate bang the impact shook a shower
from the tree, which fell on her as she passed beneath.
It seemed to her a bad omen and added to the almost
terrifying sensation of gloom that was invading her.</p>

<p>Her ring at the bell brought the whole Garcia family
to the door and the hall. A child of ten&mdash;the elder of
the young Mrs. Garcia&#8217;s boys&mdash;opened it. He was
in the condition of moisture and mud consequent on
a game of baseball on the way home from school. Behind
him crowded a smaller boy&mdash;of a cherubic beauty&mdash;arrayed
in a very dirty sailor blouse, with a still
dirtier wide white collar, upon which hung locks of
wispy yellow hair. Mrs. Garcia, the younger, came
drearily forward. She was a thin, pretty, slatternly,
young woman, very baggy about the waist, and with
the same wispy yellow hair as her son, which she wore
in the popular bang. It had been smartly curled in
the morning, but the damp had shown it no respect,
and it hung down limply nearly into her eyes. Back
of her, in the dim reaches of the hall, Mariposa saw the
grandmother, the strange old Spanish woman, who
spoke no English. She looked very old, and small,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
and was wrinkled like a walnut. But as she encountered
the girl&#8217;s miserable gaze she gave her a gentle
reassuring smile, full of that curious, patient sweetness
which comes in the faces of the old who have lived
kindly.</p>

<p>The younger members of the family escorted the new
arrival upstairs. She had seen her room before, had
already placed therein her piano and many of her
smaller ornaments, but its bleakness struck her anew.
She stopped on the threshold, looking at its chill, half-furnished
extent with a sudden throttling sense of
homesickness. It was a large room, evidently once the
state bedroom of the house, signs of its past glory lingering
in the elaborate gilt chandelier, the white wall-paper,
strewed with golden wheat-ears, and the marble
mantelpiece, with carvings of fruit at the sides. Now
she saw with renewed clearness of vision the threadbare
carpet, with a large ink-stain by the table, the
rocking-chair with one arm gone, the place on the
wall behind the sofa where the heads of previous
boarders had left their mark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your clock don&#8217;t go,&#8221; said the cherubic boy in a
loud voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to make it, but it only ticks
a minute and then stops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia, with a gesture of collapsed
hopelessness, &#8220;he&#8217;s been at your clock! I knew
he would. Have you broken her clock?&#8221; fiercely to the
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t,&#8221; he returned, not in the least overawed
by the maternal onslaught. &#8220;It were broke when it
came.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;He did break it,&#8221; said the other boy suddenly. &#8220;He
opened the back door of it and stuck a hairpin in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Garcia made a rush at her son with the evident
intention of administering corporal punishment on the
spot. But with a loud, derisive shout, he eluded her
and dashed through the doorway. Safe on the stairs,
he cried defiantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t done it, and no one can prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way they always act,&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia
despondently, pushing up her bang so that she could
the better see her new guest. &#8220;It&#8217;s no picnic having
no husband and having to slave for everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandma slaves, too,&#8221; said the rebel on the stairway;
&#8220;she slaves more&#8217;n you do, and Uncle Gam slaves
the most.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further revelations were stopped by another ring at
the bell. Visitors were evidently rare, for everybody
but Mariposa flew to the hall and precipitated themselves
down the stairs. In the general interest the recent
battle was forgotten, the rebel earning his pardon
by getting to the door before any one else. The new-comer
was Mariposa&#8217;s expressman. She had already
seen through her window the uncovered cart with her
few belongings glistening with rain.</p>

<p>The driver, a grimy youth in a steaming blouse, was
standing in the doorway with the wet receipt flapping
in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your things,&#8221; yelled the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to bring them up,&#8221; said Mariposa, who
was now at the stair-head herself.</p>

<p>The man stepped into the hall and looked up at her.
He had a singularly red and impudent face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;Not till I get my two dollars and a half,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two dollars and a half!&#8221; echoed Mariposa in
alarm, for a dollar was beginning to look larger to
her than it ever had done before. &#8220;It was only a dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dollar!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;A dollar for that load!&#8221;&mdash;pointing
to the street&mdash;&#8220;say, you&#8217;ve got a gall!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa flushed. She had never been spoken to
this way before in her life. She leaned over the balustrade
and said haughtily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring in my things, and when they&#8217;re up here I
will give you the dollar you agreed upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man gave a loud, derisive laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That beats anything!&#8221; he said, and then roared
through the door to his pard: &#8220;Say, she wants to give
us a dollar for that load. Ain&#8217;t that rich?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence in the hall. A vulgar
wrangle was almost impossible to the girl at the juncture
to which the depressing and hideous events of the
last few weeks had brought her. Yet she had still a
glimmer of spirit left, and her gorge rose at the impudent
swindle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t pay you two dollars and a half, and I will
have my things,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Bring them up at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed again, this time with an uglier
note.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not, young woman,&#8221; he said, lounging
against the balustrade. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll have to fork
out the two fifty or whistle for your things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa made no answer. Her hand shaking with
rage, she began to fumble in her pocket for her purse.
The whole Garcia family, assembled in the hallway beneath,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
breathed audibly in the tense excitement of the
moment, and kept moving their eyes from her to the
expressman and back again. The Chinaman from the
kitchen had joined them, listening with the charmed
smile which the menials of that race always wear on
occasions of domestic strife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said the man, coming a step up the stairs and
assuming a suddenly threatening air, &#8220;I can&#8217;t stay
fooling round here all day. I want my money, and I
want it quick. D&#8217;ye hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s hand closed on the purse. She would
have now paid anything to escape from this hateful
scene. At the same moment she heard a door open
behind her, a quick step in the hall, and a man suddenly
stood beside her at the stair-head. He was in his shirt-sleeves
and he had a pen in his hand.</p>

<p>The expressman, who had mounted two or three
steps, saw him and recoiled, looking startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; said the new-comer
shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want my money,&#8221; said the man doggedly, but retreating.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who owes you money? And what do you mean
by making a row like this in this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe him money,&#8221; said Mariposa. &#8220;I agreed to
pay him a dollar for carrying my things here, and now
he wants two and a half and won&#8217;t give me my
things unless I pay it. But I&#8217;ll pay what he wants
rather than fight this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was conscious of a slight, amused smile in the
very keen and clear gray eyes the man beside her
fastened for one listening moment on her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Get your dollar,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and don&#8217;t bother any
more.&#8221; Then in a loud voice down the stairway:
&#8220;Here, step out and get the trunks and don&#8217;t let&#8217;s have
any more talk about it. Ching,&#8221; to the Chinaman, &#8220;go
out and help that man with this lady&#8217;s things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinaman came forward, still grinning. The
expressman for a moment hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said the man in the shirt-sleeves, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want to have to come downstairs, I&#8217;m busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expressman, with Ching behind him, hurried
out.</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s deliverer stood at the stair-head watching
them and slightly smiling. Then he turned to her.
She was again conscious of how gray and clear his eyes
looked in his sunburned face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was writing a letter in my room, and I heard the
sound of strife long before I realized what was happening.
Why didn&#8217;t you call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was any one there,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the boys ought to have known. Why didn&#8217;t
one of you little beggars come for me?&#8221; he said to the
two boys, who were clambering slowly up the outside
of the balustrade staring from the deliverer to the expressman,
now advancing up the steps with Mariposa&#8217;s
belongings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I liked to see &#8217;em fight,&#8221; said the smaller. &#8220;I
liked it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You little scamp,&#8221; said the man, and, leaning over
the stair-rail, caught the ascending cherub by the slack
of his knickerbockers and drew him upward, shrieking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
delightedly. On the landing he gave him a slight
shake, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear any more of that kind of talk.
Next time there&#8217;s a fight, call me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expressman and Ching had now entered laden
with the luggage. They came staggering up the stairs,
scraping the walls with the corners of the trunks and
softly swearing. Mariposa started for her room, followed
by the strange man and the two boys.</p>

<p>Her deliverer was evidently a person to whom the
usages of society were matters of indifference. He
entered the room without permission or apology and
stood looking inquiringly about him, his glance passing
from the bed to the wide, old-fashioned bureau, the
rocking-chair with its arm off and the ink-stain on the
carpet. As the men entered with their burdens, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You look as if you&#8217;d be short of chairs here. I&#8217;ll
see that you get another rocker to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa wondered if Mrs. Garcia was about to
end her widowhood and this was the happy man.</p>

<p>He stood about as the men set down the luggage,
and watched the transfer of the dollar from Mariposa&#8217;s
white hand to the dingy one of her late enemy. The
boys also eyed this transaction with speechless attention,
evidently anticipating a second outbreak of hostilities.
But peace had been restored and would evidently
rule as long as the sunburned man in the shirt-sleeves
remained.</p>

<p>This he appeared to intend doing. He suggested a
change in the places of one or two of Mariposa&#8217;s pieces
of furniture, and showed her how she could use her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
screen to hide the bed. He looked annoyed over a
torn strip of loose wall-paper that hung dejected, revealing
a long seam of plaster like a seared scar. Then
he went to the window and pushed back the curtains of
faded rep.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a nice view from here on sunny days down
into the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa felt she must show interest, and went to
the window, too. The pane was not clean, and the
view commanded nothing but the splendid fountain-like
foliage of the pepper-tree and below a sodden strip
of garden in which limp chrysanthemums hung their
heads, while a ragged nasturtium vine tried to protest
its vigor by flaunting a few blossoms from the top of
the fence. It seemed to her the acme of forlornness.
The crescendo of the afternoon&#8217;s unutterable despondency
had reached its climax. Her sense of desolation
welled suddenly up into overwhelming life. It
caught her by the throat. She made a supreme effort,
and said in a shaken voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks rather damp now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her companion turned from the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boys, scoot,&#8221; he said to the two boys who
were attempting to open the trunks with the clock
key. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got no business hanging round here.
Go down and study your lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>They obediently left the room. Mariposa heard their
jubilantly clamorous descent of the stairs. She made
no attempt to leave the window, or to speak to the man,
who still remained moving about as if looking for
something. The light was growing dim in the dark
wintry day, but the girl still stood with her face to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
pane. She knew that if the tears against which she
fought should come there would be a deluge of them.
Biting her lips and clenching her hands, she stood peering
out, speechless, overwhelmed by her wretchedness.</p>

<p>Presently the man said, as if speaking to himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where the devil are the matches? Elsie&#8217;s too careless
for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard him feeling about on shelves and tables,
and after a moment he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see where the matches were? I want to
light the gas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any,&#8221; she answered without turning.</p>

<p>He gave a suppressed exclamation, and, opening
the door, left the room.</p>

<p>With the withdrawal of his restraining presence the
tension snapped. Mariposa sank down in the chair
near the window and the tears poured from her eyes,
tears in torrential volume, such as her mother had shed
twenty-five years before in front of Dan Moreau&#8217;s
cabin.</p>

<p>Her grief seized her and swept her away. She shook
with it. Why could she not die and escape from this
hideous world? It bowed her like a reed before a
wind, and she bent her face on the chair arm and trembled
and throbbed.</p>

<p>She did not hear the door open, nor know that her
solitude was again invaded, till she heard the man&#8217;s
step beside her. Then she started up, strangled with
sobs and indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you again?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see how
miserable I am?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;I saw it the moment I came out of my room this
afternoon,&#8221; he answered quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I disturb
you. I only wanted to light the gas and get the place
a little more cheerful and warm. It&#8217;s too cold in here.
You go on crying. Don&#8217;t bother about me; I&#8217;m going
to light the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She obeyed him, too abject in her misery to care.
He lit all the gases in the gilt chandelier, and then
knelt before the fireplace. Soon the snapping of the
wood contested the silence with the small, pathetic
noises of the woman&#8217;s weeping. She felt&mdash;at first without
consciousness&mdash;the grateful warmth of the blaze.
Presently she removed the wad of saturated handkerchief
from her face. The room was inundated by a
flood of light, the leaping gleam of the flames licking
the glaze of the few old-fashioned ornaments and
evoking uncertain gleams from the long mirror standing
on the floor in the corner. The man was sitting
before the fire. He had his coat on now, and Mariposa
could see that he was tall and powerful, a bronzed and
muscular man of about thirty-five years of age, with a
face tanned to mahogany color, thick-brown hair and
a brown mustache. His hand, as it rested on his knee,
caught her eye; it was well formed, but worn as a
laborer&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to come and sit near the fire?&#8221; he
said, without moving his head.</p>

<p>She murmured a negative.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that your clock is all off,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;There&#8217;s something the matter with it. I&#8217;ll fix it for
you this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and lifted the clock from the mantelpiece.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
It was a small timepiece of French gilt, one of the
many presents her father had given her mother in their
days of affluence.</p>

<p>As he lifted it Mariposa suddenly experienced a return
of misery at the thought that he was going. At
the idea of being again left to herself her wretchedness
rushed back upon her with redoubled force. She felt
that the flood of tears would begin again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t go,&#8221; she said, with the imploring urgency
of old friendship. &#8220;I&#8217;m so terribly depressed. Don&#8217;t
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips trembled, her swollen eyes were without
light or beauty. She was as distinctly unlovely as a
handsome woman can be. The man, however, did not
look at her. He had opened the door of the clock
and was studying its internal machinery. He answered
quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go now for a while. I must finish my
letter. It&#8217;s got to go out to-night, but I was going to
ask you if you wouldn&#8217;t like to have your supper up
here? It&#8217;s now a little after five; at six o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll
bring it, and if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll bring mine up,
too. I just take tea and some bread and butter and
jam or stuff&mdash;whatever Elsie happens to have round.
If you&#8217;d like it, you fix up the table and get things into
some sort of shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked toward the door. With the handle in
his hand he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind my taking mine up here, too, do
you? If you do, just say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; said Mariposa, in the stifled voice
of the weeper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>When he had gone she listlessly tried to create some
kind of order in the chaotic room. She felt exhausted
and indifferent. Once she found herself looking at
her watch with a sort of heavy desire to have the time
pass quickly. She dreaded her loneliness. She caught
a glimpse of herself in the chimney-piece glass and felt
neither shame nor disgust at her unsightly appearance.</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock she heard the quick, decisive step in
the hall that earlier in the afternoon had broken in on
her wrangle with the expressman. A knock came on
the door that sounded exceedingly like a kick bestowed
under difficulties. She opened it, and her new friend
entered bearing a large tray set forth with the paraphernalia
of a cold supper and with the evening paper
laid on top. He put it on the cleared table, and together
they lifted off its contents and set them forth.
There was cold meat, jam, bread and butter, a brown
pottery teapot with the sprout broken and two very
beautiful cups, delicate and richly decorated. Then
they sat down, one at each side of the table, and the
meal began.</p>

<p>Mariposa did not care to eat. Sitting under the
blaze of the gilt chandelier, with the firelight gilding
one side of her flushed and disfigured face, she poured
out the tea, while her companion attacked the cold meat
with good appetite. The broken spout leaked, and she
found herself guiltily regarding the man opposite, as
she surreptitiously tried to sop up with a napkin the
streams of tea it sent over the table-cloth.</p>

<p>He appeared to have the capacity for seeing anything
that occurred in his vicinity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;Never mind the teapot,&#8221; he said, with his mouth
full; &#8220;it always does that. It&#8217;s no good getting a new
one. I think the boys break them. Elsie says they
play boats with them in the bath-tub.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa made no reply, and the meal progressed
in silence. Presently her <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> held out his cup
for a second filling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What beautiful cups,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It would be a
pity to break them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re grandma&#8217;s. They&#8217;re the only two left.
Grandma had some stunning things, brought round
The Horn by her husband in the early days, before the
Gringo came. He was a great man in his day, Don
Manuel Garcia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she your grandmother, too?&#8221; Mariposa asked.
It seemed natural to put pointblank questions to this
man, who so completely swept aside the smaller conventions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine? Oh, Lord, no. My poor old granny died
crossing the plains in &#8217;49. I was there, but I don&#8217;t
remember it. I call old lady Garcia grandma, because
I&#8217;m here so much, and because I look upon them as my
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live here always?&#8221; asked Mariposa, looking
with extinguished eyes over the piece of bread she was
nibbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I live at the mines. I&#8217;m a miner. My stamping-ground&#8217;s
the whole Sierra from Siskiyou to Tuolumne.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with a queer, whimsical smile.
His strong white teeth gleamed for a moment from between
his bearded lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m up at the Sierra a lot of the time,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and then I&#8217;m down here a lot more of the time. I
come here to find my victims. I locate a good prospect
in the Sierra, and I come down here to sell it.
That&#8217;s my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; asked Mariposa suddenly,
hearing herself ask this last and most pertinent question
with the dry glibness of an interviewer.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name? Great Scott, you don&#8217;t know it!&#8221; he
threw back his head and a jolly, sonorous laugh filled
the room. &#8220;That&#8217;s great, you and I sitting here together
over supper as if we&#8217;d grown up together in
the same nursery, and you don&#8217;t know what my name
is. It&#8217;s Gamaliel Barron. Do you like it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mariposa, gravely, &#8220;it&#8217;s a very nice
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you think so. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m much attached
to the front end of it. It&#8217;s a Bible name. I
haven&#8217;t the least idea who the gentleman was, or what
he did, but he&#8217;s in the Bible somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saul sat at his feet,&#8221; said Mariposa; &#8220;he was a great
teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m afraid his namesake isn&#8217;t much like him.
I never taught anybody anything, and certainly no
one ever sat at my feet, and I&#8217;d hate it if they did.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause, while Barron continued
his supper with unabated gusto. He had finished the
cold meat and was now spreading jam on bread and
butter and eating it, with alternate mouthfuls of tea.
Though he ate rapidly, as one accustomed to take his
meals alone, he ate like a gentleman. She found herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
regarding him with a listless curiosity, faintly
wondering what manner of man he was.</p>

<p>Looking up he met her eyes and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be very comfortable here. Don&#8217;t let the first
glimpse discourage you. Elsie&#8217;s careless, and the boys
are pretty wild, but they&#8217;re all right when you come
to know them better, and grandma&#8217;s fine. There&#8217;s
not many women in San Francisco to match old Se&ntilde;ora
Garcia. She&#8217;s the true kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity her son died!&#8221; said Mariposa.</p>

<p>He raised his head instantly and an expression of
pain passed over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, there,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;That
was one of the hardest things that ever happened. If
there&#8217;s a God I&#8217;d like to know why he let it happen.
Juan Garcia was the salt of the earth&mdash;a great man.
He was the best son, the best husband and the best
friend I ever knew. And he was killed offhand, for
no reason, by an unnecessary accident, leaving these
poor, helpless creatures this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his head toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew him well?&#8221; said Mariposa.</p>

<p>The gray eyes looked into hers very gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was my best friend,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;the best
friend any man ever had in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl saw he was moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people we love, and depend on, and live for
always die,&#8221; she said gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;But others come up. They don&#8217;t quite take their
places, but they fill up the holes in the ranks. We&#8217;re
not expected always to love comfortably and be happy.
We&#8217;re expected to work; that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re here for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
and there&#8217;s plenty of it to do. Haven&#8217;t I got my work
cut out for me,&#8221; suddenly laughing, &#8220;in those two
boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s pale lips showed the ripple of an assenting
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re certainly a serious proposition,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and poor Elsie can&#8217;t any more manage &#8217;em than
she could ride a bucking bronco. But they&#8217;ll pull out
all right. Don&#8217;t you worry. Those boys are all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to return to the remnants of the supper
when his eyes fell on the folded paper, which had
been pushed to one side of the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look!&#8221; he said; &#8220;we forgot the paper. You&#8217;ve
finished; wouldn&#8217;t you like to see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. The paper had not much interest
for her at the best of times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll run my eye over
it, while you make me another cup of tea. Three cups
are my limit&mdash;one lump and milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed her the cup, already shaking the paper
out of its folds. She was struggling with the leakage
of the broken spout, when he gave a loud ejaculation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Scott! here&#8217;s news!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she queried, the broken teapot suspended
over the cup.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake Shackleton&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>The teapot fell with a crash on the table. Her
mouth opened, her face turned an amazing pallor, and
she sat staring at the astonished man with horror-stricken
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221; she gasped; &#8220;why everybody&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron dropped the paper on the floor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m so awfully sorry; I didn&#8217;t know you knew him
well. I didn&#8217;t know he was a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friend!&#8221; she echoed, almost with a shriek.
&#8220;Friend! Why, he was my father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice ended in a wild peal of laughter, horrible,
almost maniacal.</p>

<p>The man, paying no attention to her words, realized
that the strain of the day and her overwhelming depression
of spirits had completely unbalanced her.
Her wild laughter suddenly gave way to wilder tears.
In a moment he ran to the door to summon the se&ntilde;ora,
but in the next, remembered that Elsie and the boys
would undoubtedly accompany her, and that the
woman before him was in no state to be exposed to
their uncomprehending stares.</p>

<p>Hysterics were new to him, but he had a vague idea
that water administered suddenly from a pitcher was
the only authorized cure. He seized the pitcher from
the wash-stand, began to sprinkle her somewhat timidly
with his fingers, and finally ended by pouring a
fair amount on her head.</p>

<p>It had the desired effect. Gasping, saturated, but
dragged back to some sort of control, by the chill current
running from her head in rillets over her body,
Mariposa sat up. The man was standing before her,
anxiously regarding her, the pitcher held ready for
another application. She pushed it away with an icy
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right now,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;You&#8217;d better go.
And&mdash;and&mdash;if I said anything silly, you understand, I
didn&#8217;t know what I was saying. I meant&mdash;that Mr.
Shackleton was a <i>friend</i> of my father&#8217;s. He&#8217;s been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
very good to me. It gave me an awful shock. Please
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron set down the pitcher and went. He was
overcome with pity for the broken creature, and furious
with himself for the shock he had given her. The
words she had uttered had made little impression on
him at first. It was afterward, while he was in the
silence of his own room, that they recurred to him with
more significance. For a space he thought of the remark
and her explanation of it with some wonder.
But before he settled to sleep, he had pushed the matter
from his mind, setting it down as the meaningless
utterance of an hysterical woman.</p>

<p>For two days after her hysterical outburst Mariposa
kept her room, sick in body and mind. The quick
succession of nerve-shattering events, ending with the
death of Shackleton, seemed to stun her. She lay
on the sofa, white and motionless, irresponsive even to
the summons of the boys, who drummed cheerfully on
her door as soon as they came home from school.</p>

<p>Fortunately for her, solitude was as difficult to find
in that slipshod <i>m&eacute;nage</i> as method or order. When
the boys were at school, young Mrs. Garcia, in the
disarray that attended the accomplishment of her
household tasks, mounted to her first-floor boarder
and regaled her with mingled accounts of past splendors
and present miseries. Mrs. Garcia spoke freely
of her husband and the affluence with which he had
surrounded her. The listener, looking at the faded,
blond prettiness of her foolish face, wondered how
the Juan Garcia that Gamaliel Barron had described
could have loved her. Mariposa had yet to learn that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Nature mates the strong men of the world to the feeble
women, in an effort to maintain an equilibrium.</p>

<p>Once or twice the old se&ntilde;ora came upstairs, carrying
some dainty in a covered dish. She had been born
at Monterey and had come to San Francisco as a bride
in the late fifties, but had never learned English, speaking
the sonorous Spanish of her girlhood to every one
she met, whether it was understood or not. Even in
the complete wreck of fortune and position, in which
Mariposa saw her, she was a fine example of the highest
class of Spanish Californian, that once brilliant and
picturesque race, careless, simple, lazy, happy, lords
of a kingdom whose value they never guessed, possessors
of limitless acres on which their cattle grazed.</p>

<p>The day after Shackleton&#8217;s death Mrs. Willers appeared,
still aghast at the suddenness of the catastrophe.
Mariposa did not know that a few days previously,
Shackleton had acquainted the newspaper
woman with his intention of sending her to Paris with
Miss Moreau, the post of correspondent to <i>The Trumpet</i>
being assigned to her. It had been the culminating
point of Mrs. Willers&#8217; life of struggle. Now all that
lay shattered. Be it said to her credit her disappointment
was more for the girl than for herself. She
knew that Shackleton had made no definite arrangements
for the starting of Mariposa on her way. All
had been <i>in statu quo</i>, attending on the daughter&#8217;s recovery
from her mother&#8217;s loss. Now death had stepped
in and forever closed the door upon these hopes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers found Mariposa strangely apathetic.
She had tried to cheer her and then had seen, to her
amazement, that the girl showed little disappointment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
That the sudden blow had upset her was obvious. She
undoubtedly looked ill. But the wrenching from her
hand of liberty, independence, possibilities of fame,
seemed to affect her little. She listened in silence
to Mrs. Willers&#8217; account of the Bonanza King&#8217;s
death. As an &#8220;inside writer&#8221; on <i>The Trumpet</i> the
newspaper woman had heard every detail of the tragic
event discussed threadbare in the perturbed office.
Shackleton had been found, as the paper stated, sitting
at his desk in the library at Menlo Park. He had been
writing letters when death called him. His wife had
come in late at night and found him thus, leaning on
the desk as if tired. It was an aneurism, the doctors
said. The heart had been diseased for years. No one,
however, had had any idea of it. Poor Mrs. Shackleton
was completely prostrated. It was not newspaper
talk that she was in a state of collapse.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was enough to collapse any woman,&#8221; said
Mrs. Willers, with a sympathetic wag of the head, &#8220;to
come in and find your husband sitting up at his desk
stone dead. And a good husband, too. It would
have given me a shock to have found Willers that
way, and even an obituary notice in the paper of which
he was proprietor could hardly have called Willers a
good husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days&#8217; rest restored Mariposa to some sort of
balance. She still felt weak and stunned in heart and
brain. The lack of interest she had shown to Mrs.
Willers had been the outward sign of this internal benumbed
condition. But as she slowly dressed on the
morning of the third day, she felt a slight ripple of
returning life, a thawing of these congealed faculties.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
She heard the quick, decisive step of Barron in the
hallway outside, and then its stoppage at her door,
and his call through the crack, &#8220;How are you this
morning? Better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;I&#8217;m getting up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First-rate. Couldn&#8217;t do better. Get a move on and
go out. It&#8217;s a day that would put life into a mummy.
I&#8217;d take you out myself, but I&#8217;ve got to go down town
and lasso one of my victims.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he clattered down the stairs. Mariposa had
not seen him since their supper together. Every morning
he had stopped and called a greeting of some sort
through the door. She shrank from meeting him
again. The extraordinary remark she had made to
him haunted her. The only thing that appeased her
was the memory of his face, in which there was no
consciousness of the meaning of her words, only consternation
and amaze at the effect his news had produced.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a wonderful day. Through her
parted curtains she saw details of the splendor in the
bits of turquoise sky between the houses, and the vivid
greens of the rain-washed gardens. When the sun
was well up, and the opened window let in delicious
earth scents, she put on her hat and jacket and went
out, turning her steps to that high spine of the city
along the crest of which California Street runs.</p>

<p>Has any place been found where there are finer days
than those San Francisco can show in winter? &#8220;The
breaks in the rain,&#8221; old Californians call them. It is
the rain that gives them their glory, for the whole
world has been washed clean and gleams like an agate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
beneath a wave. The skies reflect this clearness of
tint. There are no clouds. The whole arch is a rich
blue, fading at the horizon to a thin, pale transparency.
The landscape is painted with a few washes of fresh
primary colors, each one deep, but limpid, like the
tints in the heart of a gem. And in this crystalline
purity of atmosphere every line is cut with unfaltering
distinctness. There is no faintness, no breath of haze,
or forgotten film of fog. Nature seems even jealous of
the smoke wreaths that rise from the city to blur the
beauty of the mighty picture, and the gray spirals are
hurriedly dispersed.</p>

<p>Mariposa walked slowly, ascending by a zigzag
course from street to street, idly looking at the houses
and gardens as she passed. People of consideration
had for some time been on the move from South Park
to this side of town. The streets through which the
young girl&#8217;s course led her were now the gathering
place of the city&#8217;s successful citizens. On the heights
above them, the new millionaires were raising palaces,
which they were emulating on the ascending slopes.
Great houses reared themselves on every sunny corner.
The architecture of the bay-windowed mansion
with the two lions sleeping on the front steps had supplanted
that of the dignified, plastered-brick fronts,
with the long lines of windows opening on wrought-iron
balconies.</p>

<p>These huge wooden edifices housed the wealth and
fashion of the city. Mariposa paused and stood with
knit brows, looking down from a vantage-point on the
glittering curve of greenhouse and the velvet lawns
of Jake Shackleton&#8217;s town house; there was no sign of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
life or occupation about it. Curtains of lace veiled its
innumerable windows. Only in the angle of lawn and
garden that abutted on the intersection of two streets,
a man, in his shirt-sleeves, was cutting calla lilies from
the hedge that topped the high stone wall which rose
from the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Finally, on the crest of the hill, where California
Street runs between its palaces, the girl paused and
looked about her. The great buildings were new, and
stood, vast, awe-compelling monuments to California&#8217;s
material glory. Their owners were still trying to make
themselves comfortable in them. There were sons and
daughters to be married from them. Perched high
above the city, in these many-windowed aeries, they
could look down on the town they had seen grow from
a village in the days when they, too, had been young,
poor and struggling. What memories must have
crowded their minds as they thought of the San Francisco
they had first seen, and the San Francisco they
saw now; of themselves as they had been then, and as
they were now!</p>

<p>Mariposa leaned against a convenient wall top and
looked down. The city lay clear-edged and gray in
the cup made by its encircling hills. It had not yet
thrown out feelers toward the Mission hills, and they
rose above the varied sweep of roof and chimney, in
undulating greenness, flecked here and there by the
white dot of a cottage. The girdle of the bay shone
sapphire-blue on this day of still sunshine. From its
farther side other hills were revealed, each peak and
shoulder clear cut against its neighbor and defining
themselves in a crumpled, cobalt line against the faint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
sky. Over all Mount Diavolo rose, a purple point,
pricking up above the green of newly grassed hills,
about whose feet hung a white fringe of little towns.</p>

<p>Turning her eyes again on the descending walls and
roofs, the watcher saw a long cort&egrave;ge passing soberly
between the gray house-fronts on a street a few blocks
below her. As she looked the boom of solemn music
rose to her. It was a funeral, and one of unusual
length, she thought, as her eyes caught the slow line of
carriages far back through breaks in the houses. Presently,
in the opening where two streets crossed, the
hearse came into view, black and gloomy, with its nodding
tufts of feathers and somberly caparisoned horses.
Men walked behind it, and the measured music swelled
louder, melancholy and yet inspiring.</p>

<p>Suddenly she realized whose it was. The rich man
was going splendidly to his rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father!&#8221; she whispered to herself. &#8220;My father!
How strange! how strange!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cort&egrave;ge passed on, the music swelling grandiosely
and then dying down into fitful snatches of
sweetness. The long line of carriages moved slowly
forward, at a crawling foot-pace.</p>

<p>The daughter leaned on the coping of the wall,
watching this last passage through the city of the
father she had known so slightly and toward whom she
felt a bitter and silent resentment.</p>

<p>She watched the nodding plumes till they were out
of sight. How strangely death had drawn together
the three that life had separated! In six months the
woman and two men, tied together by a twist of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
hand of Fate, had been summoned, one after the other,
into the darkness beyond. Would they meet there?
Mariposa shuddered and turned away. The black
plumes had disappeared, but the music still boomed
fitfully in measured majesty.</p>

<p>The whistles were blowing for midday when she retraced
her steps to the Garcia house. As she mounted
the stairs to the front door she became aware that
there were several people grouped on the balcony,
their forms dimly visible through the grimy glass and
behind the rampart of long-stemmed geraniums that
grew there in straggling neglect. The opening of the
outer door let her in on them. She started and slightly
changed color when she saw that one of the figures
was that of Gamaliel Barron. He was sitting on the
arm of a dilapidated rocker, frowningly staring at Benito,
the younger Garcia boy, against whom, it appeared,
a charge of some moment had just been
brought. The case was being placed before Barron,
who evidently acted as judge, by a person Mariposa
had not seen before&mdash;a tall, thin young man of some
thirty years, with a stoop in the shoulders, a shock of
fine black hair, and a pair of very soft and beautiful
blue eyes.</p>

<p>They were so preoccupied in the matter before
them that no effort was made to introduce the stranger
to Mariposa, though Barron offered her his armchair,
retiring to a seat on the balcony railing, whence he
loomed darkly severe, from among the straggling
geraniums. Benito, in his sailor collar and wispy
curls, maintained an air of smiling innocence, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Miguel, the elder boy, who was an interested witness,
bore evidence of uneasiness of mind in the strained
attention of the face turned toward Barron.</p>

<p>Mariposa paused, her hand on the back of the rocking-chair.
Benito had already inserted himself into
her affections. She looked from one to the other to
ascertain his offense. Both men were regarding the
culprit, Barron with frowning disapproval, the other
with eyes full of amusement. It was he who proceeded
to state the case against the accused:</p>

<p>&#8220;She leaned over the railing and said to me, &#8216;Them
little boys will be sick if they eat that crab.&#8217; &#8216;What
crab and what little boys?&#8217; I asked, quite innocently,
and she answered, &#8216;Them little boys in the vacant
lot!&#8217; Then I turned and saw Benito and Miguel squatting
in the grass among the tomato cans and fragments
of the daily press, with a crab that they were
breaking up between them, a crab about as big as a
cart-wheel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We found it there,&#8221; said Benito. &#8220;It were just
lying there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If they eat that crab,&#8217; the lady continued, &#8216;they&#8217;ll
be sick. It ain&#8217;t no good. I threw it out myself. And
I&#8217;ve been hollerin&#8217; to them to stop, and that little one
with the curls, just turned round on me and says,
&#8220;Oh, you go to the devil!&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The complainant paused, looked at Mariposa with
an eye in which she saw laughter dancing, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rather a startling way for a gentleman to
speak to a lady, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Though the language used by the accused was hard
to associate with his cherubic appearance, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
somewhat shocked Mariposa&#8217;s affection, she could
hardly repress a smile. Benito grinning, as if with
pride at the prowess he had shown in the encounter
with the strange female, looked at his brother and
emitted an explosive laugh. Miguel, however, had
more clearly guessed the seriousness of the offense,
and looked uneasy. Barron was regarding the younger
boy with unmoved and angry gravity. Mariposa saw
that the man was not in the least inclined to treat
the matter humorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you really say that, Benito?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Benito, swaying his body from side to
side, and fastening his eyes on a knife he had carelessly
extracted from his pocket, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t see what
she had to do with that crab. It was all alone in the
vacant lot. How was we to know it was her crab?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; to Miguel, &#8220;she told you before not to touch
it, that it was bad, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the elder boy, exceedingly uncomfortable.
&#8220;She come and leaned over the railing and
hollered at us not to touch it, that it was bad and it &#8217;ud
make us sick. Then I stopped &#8217;cause I didn&#8217;t want to
get sick. But Ben wouldn&#8217;t, and she hollered again,
and then he told her to go to the devil, and Mr. Pierpont
came along just then, and she told him, and Ben
got skairt and stopped.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence. The younger boy
continued to smile and finger his knife, but it was evident
he was not so easy in his mind. The stranger,
now with difficulty restraining his laughter, turned
again to Mariposa and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If the lady had been in any way aggressing on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
young gentleman&#8217;s comfort or convenience, it would
not have been exactly justifiable, but comprehensible.
But when you consider that her sole desire was to save
him from eating something that would make him sick,
then you begin to realize the seriousness of the offense.
Oh, Benito, you&#8217;re in a bad way, I&#8217;m afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t nothing of the kind,&#8221; said Benito, smiling
and showing his dimples. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t done nothing more
than Miguel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell her to go to the devil,&#8221; exclaimed
Miguel, in a loud, combative voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I said it first,&#8221; replied his brother, calmly.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t have time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Benito,&#8221; said Barron, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got no use for
you when you behave that way. There&#8217;s no excuse for
it. You&#8217;ve used the worst kind of language to a lady
who was trying to do a decent thing. I won&#8217;t take you
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change on Benito&#8217;s face was sudden and piteous.
The smile was frozen on his lips, he turned
crimson, and said stammeringly, evidently hardly believing
his ears:</p>

<p>&#8220;To see the balloon? Oh, Uncle Gam, you promised
it for a week. Oh, I&#8217;d rather see the balloon than anything.
Oh, Uncle Gam!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use talking; I won&#8217;t take a boy who behaves
that way. I&#8217;m angry with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was absolutely grave and, Mariposa saw,
spoke the truth when he said he was angry. The boy
was about to plead, when probably a knowledge of the
hopelessness of such a course silenced him. With a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
flushed face, he stood before the tribunal fighting with
his tears, proud and silent. When he could no longer
control them he turned and rushed into the house,
his bursting sobs issuing from the hallway. Miguel
charged after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, poor little fellow!&#8221; cried Mariposa; &#8220;how
could you? Take him to see the balloon; do, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron made no reply, sitting on the railing, frowning
and abstracted. She turned her eyes on the other
man. He was still smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barron&#8217;s bringing up the boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and he
takes it hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the man from the railing, &#8220;who
would? Heaven knows I don&#8217;t want to disappoint the
poor little cuss, but somebody&#8217;s got to try and keep
him in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you punish him some other way? He&#8217;s been
talking about seeing the balloon for days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to goodness I&#8217;d somebody to help me,&#8221; said
the judge moodily; &#8220;I&#8217;m not up to this sort of work.
It makes me feel the meanest thing that walks to get
up and punish a boy for things that are just what I
did when I was the same age. But what&#8217;s a man to
do? I can&#8217;t see those children go to the devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>The howls of Benito had been rising loudly from
the house for some minutes. They now suffered a
sudden check; there was a quick step in the hall and
Mrs. Garcia appeared in the doorway, red and angry.
Benito was at her side, eating a large slice of cake.</p>

<p>&#8220;What d&#8217;ye mean, Gam Barron,&#8221; she said in a high
key, &#8220;by making my son cry that way? Ain&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
got no better use for your time than to tease and torment
a poor, little, helpless boy, who&#8217;s got no father
to protect him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t teasing him, Elsie,&#8221; he answered quietly;
&#8220;I only said I wouldn&#8217;t take him out this afternoon
because he behaved badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ain&#8217;t that teasing, when you promised it for
a week and more? That&#8217;s what I call a snide trick.
It&#8217;s just because you want to go somewhere else, I
know. And so you put it off on that woman and the
crab. Much good she is, anyway; I know her, too.
Never mind, my baby,&#8221; fondly to Benito, stroking his
hair with her hand, &#8220;mother&#8217;ll take you to see the
balloon herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benito jerked himself away from the maternal hand
and said, with his mouth full of cake:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go with you; I want to go with
Uncle Gam. He lets me ride in the goat-cart and buy
peanuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go with me,&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia with asperity,
&#8220;or you&#8217;ll not go at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go with you,&#8221; said Benito, beginning
to grow clamorous; &#8220;I don&#8217;t have fun when I go
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go with me, or stay home shut up in the
cupboard all afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t; no, I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Benito was both tearful and enraged. His mother
caught his hand and, holding it in a tense grip, bent
her face down to his and said with set emphasis:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to stay all afternoon in the kitchen
cupboard?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>He struggled to be free, reiterating:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, and I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to. I think you&#8217;re
real mean to me; I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to go nowhere with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, ungrateful little boy,&#8221; said his parent,
furiously, shaking the hand she held. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk
back to me. You&#8217;ll go with me this afternoon and see
that balloon if I have to drag you all the way. Yes,
you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; roared Benito, now enraged past all control;
and in his frenzy to escape he kicked at his
mother&#8217;s ankles through her intervening skirts.</p>

<p>This was too much for Mrs. Garcia&#8217;s feelings as a
mother. She took her free hand and boxed Benito
smartly on the ear. Then for a moment there was
war. Benito kicked, roaring lustily, while his mother
cuffed. The din of combat was loud on the balcony,
and several of the geranium pots were knocked over.</p>

<p>It remained for Barron to descend from the railing
and drag the boy away from his wrathful parent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, stop kicking your mother,&#8221; he said peremptorily;
&#8220;that won&#8217;t do at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then make her stop slapping me,&#8221; howled Benito.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I got a right to kick back? I guess you&#8217;d kick
all right if you was slapped that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said his mother from the doorway,
&#8220;next time you come to me, Benito Garcia, to be taken
to the circus or the fair, you&#8217;ll find out that you&#8217;ve
barked up the wrong tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; responded Benito defiantly; &#8220;grandma
or Uncle Gam will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes after her irate withdrawal she reappeared,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
calm and smiling, the memory of her recent
combat showing only in her heightened color, and
announced that lunch was ready.</p>

<p>At lunch the stranger was introduced to Mariposa,
and she learned that he was Isaac Pierpont, a singing
teacher living in the house.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when Jake Shackleton
went to his account Essex had walked slowly to Bertrand&#8217;s
<i>r&ocirc;tisserie</i>, his head drooped, the evening paper
in his hand.</p>

<p>Two hours before the cries of the newsboys announcing
the sudden demise of his chief had struck
on his ear, for the first moment freezing him into motionless
amazement. Standing under a lamp, he had
read the short report, then hurried down to the office of
<i>The Trumpet</i>. There in the turmoil and hubbub which
marks the first portentous movement of the great
daily making ready to go to press, he had heard fuller
details. The office was in an uproar, shaken to its
foundation by the startling news, every man and
woman ready with a speculation or a rumor as to the
ultimate fate of <i>The Trumpet</i>, on which their own little
fates hung.</p>

<p>At his table in the far corner of Bertrand&#8217;s he mused
over the various reports he had heard. The death of
Shackleton would undoubtedly throw the present makeup
of <i>The Trumpet</i> out of gear. Its sale would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
inevitable. From what he had heard of him, Win
Shackleton would be quite incapable of taking his
father&#8217;s place as proprietor and manager of the paper
that Jake Shackleton, the man of brain and initiative,
was transforming into a powerful organ of public
opinion. And in the general weeding out of men
which would unquestionably occur, why should not
Barry Essex mount to a top place?</p>

<p><i>The Trumpet</i> had always paid its capable men large
salaries. It was worth while considering. Essex had
now decided to remain in San Francisco, at least
throughout the winter. The climate pleased him; the
cosmopolitan atmosphere of the remote, picturesque
city continued to exert its charm. The very duck he
was now eating, far beyond his purse in any other
American city, was an inducement to remain. But
the real one was the woman, all the more desperately
desired because denied him. Her indignation had not
repelled him, but he saw it would mean a long wooing.</p>

<p>Once in his own room, he kindled the fire and drew
toward him a pile of reference books he had to consult
for an article on the great actresses of the French
stage from Clairon to Rachel. These light and brilliant
essays had been an experiment of Shackleton&#8217;s,
who maintained that the Sunday edition should furnish
food for all types of minds. Essex had produced exactly
the class of matter wanted, and received for it the
generous pay that the proprietor of <i>The Trumpet</i> was
always ready to give for good work.</p>

<p>The reader was fluttering the leaves of the first book
of the pile when a knock at the door stopped him. He
knew it was his neighbor across the hall, who had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
in bed for over a week, sick with bronchitis. Essex
had seen the man several times during his seclusion and
had conceived a carelessly cynical interest in him.</p>

<p>When sober, he had developed remarkable anecdotal
capacity, which had immensely amused his new acquaintance.
Tales of &#8217;49 and the early Comstock
days, scandals of those now in high places, discreditable
accounts of the making of fortunes, flowed
from his lips in a high-colored and diverting stream.
If they were lies they were exceedingly ingenious ones.
Essex saw material for a dozen novels in the man&#8217;s revealing
and lurid recitals. Of his own personal history
he was reticent, merely saying that his name was
George Harney, and his trade that of job-printer.
Drink had almost destroyed him. Physically he was
a mere bunch of nerves covered by flabby, sallow flesh.</p>

<p>In answer to Essex&#8217;s &#8220;come in,&#8221; the door opened
and Harney shambled into the room. He was fully
dressed, but showed the evidences of illness in his
hollowed cheeks and eyes, and the yellow skin hanging
flaccid round jaw and throat. His hand shook and
his gait was uncertain, but he was perfectly sober.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to have a squint at the paper, Doc,&#8221; he said
in a hoarse voice. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go out with this blasted
wheezing on me. Don&#8217;t want to die in my prime.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex threw the paper across the table at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s news to-night,&#8221; he said, taking up his book;
&#8220;Shackleton&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man stopped as if electrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shackleton? Jake Shackleton?&#8221; he said in a loud
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake Shackleton,&#8221; answered Essex, surprised at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
the startled astonishment of his face. &#8220;Did you know
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Harney snatched the paper and opened it with an
unsteady hand. He ran his eyes over the lines under
the black-lettered heading of the first page.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gosh!&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;so he is; so he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down in the chair at the opposite side of the
table, smoothed out the sheet and read the account
slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;By gosh!&#8221; he said again when he had finished,
&#8220;who&#8217;d a thought Jake&#8217;d go off like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know him?&#8221; repeated Essex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once up in the Sierra, when we was all mining up
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke absently and sat looking into the fire for
a moment, then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty tough luck to be whisked off that way
when you just got everything in the palm of your
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex made no reply, and after a pause he added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Between fifteen and twenty millions it says there,&#8221;
indicating the paper, &#8220;and when I saw Jake Shackleton
first you wouldn&#8217;t er hired him to sweep down the
steps of <i>The Trumpet</i> office. But that was twenty-five
years ago at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Shackleton was an able man. There&#8217;s no
question about that. They were saying in the office
to-night that twenty million is a conservative figure
to put his money at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who does it go to? Do you know that?&#8221; queried
the man by the fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;Widow and children, I suppose. There are two
children. Don&#8217;t amount to anything, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there are three.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harney turned from the fire and looked over his
shoulder. He was sitting in a hunched position, his
back rounded, his chin depressed. His black eyes,
that drew close to the nose, were instinct with eager
cunning. The skin across the bridge of the nose was
drawn in wrinkles. As he looked the wheezing of his
disturbed breathing was distinctly audible. Essex was
struck by the sly and malevolent intelligence of his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three children!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve always heard
the death of a bonanza king was the signal for a large
crop of widows and orphans to take the field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be any widow this time. She&#8217;s dead.
But the girl&#8217;s alive, and I&#8217;ve seen her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He accompanied this remark with a second look,
significant with the same malicious intensity of meaning.
Then he rose to his feet and walked toward the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night, Doc,&#8221; he said as he reached it; &#8220;ain&#8217;t
well enough to talk to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex gave him a return good night and the door
closed on him. The younger man cogitated over his
books for a space. It did not strike him as interesting
or remarkable that Shackleton should have had an unacknowledged
child, of whose existence George Harney,
the drunken job-printer, knew. He was becoming
accustomed to the extraordinary intermingling of
classes and conditions that marked the pioneer period<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
of California life. But should the unacknowledged
child attempt to establish its claim to part of the great
estate left by the bonanza king, what a complication
that might lead to! These Californians were certainly
a picturesque people, with their dramatic ups and
downs of fortune, their disdain of accepted standards,
their indifference to tradition, and their magnificently
disreputable pasts.</p>

<p>As one of the special writers of <i>The Trumpet</i>, Essex
attended the funeral of his chief. He and Mrs. Willers
and Edna, in company with the young woman
who did the &#8220;Fashions and Foibles&#8221; column, were in
one of the carriages that Mariposa had seen from the
hilltop. Mrs. Willers was silent on the long, slow
drive. She had honored her chief, who had been just
to her. Miss Peebles, the &#8220;Fashions and Foibles&#8221;
young woman, was so engrossed by her fears that a
change of ownership in <i>The Trumpet</i> would rob her of
her employment that she could talk of nothing else.
To Edna, the sensation of being in a carriage was so
novel it occupied her to the exclusion of all other matters,
and she looked out of the window with a face of
sparkling interest.</p>

<p>That evening, after the funeral, Essex was preparing
to work late. He had &#8220;gutted&#8221; the pile of books,
and with their contents well assimilated was ready to
write his three columns. There was no car line on the
street, and traffic at that hour on that quiet thoroughfare
was over for the day. For an hour he wrote
easily and fluently. The sheets, glistening with damp
ink, were pushed in front of him in a careless pile.
Now and then he paused to consult his books, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
were arranged round him on the table, open at the
places he needed for reference. The smoke wreaths
were thick round his head and the room was hot. It
was nearly ten o&#8217;clock when he heard the noisy entrance
of his fellow lodger. Harney was evidently
sufficiently well to go to work again and to come home
drunk. Essex listened with suspended pen and a half-smile
on his dark face, which turned to a frown as he
realized that the stumbling feet had turned his way.
The knock on the door came next, and simultaneously
it opened and Harney&#8217;s head was thrust in.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil do you want?&#8221; said the scribe, sitting
erect, his pipe in his hand, the other waving
the smoke strata that hung before his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me come and get warm a minute. I&#8217;m wheezing
again, and my room&#8217;s cold as a tomb. Don&#8217;t mind
me&mdash;all I want is to set before the fire for a spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sidled in before the permission was granted and
sank down in the armchair, hitching it nearer to the
grate. He was a man to whom intoxication lent a
curiously amiable and humorous quality. The ugliness
and evil that were so evidently part of his nature
were not so apparent, and he became cheerful, almost
genial.</p>

<p>Sitting close to the fire, he held out his hands to the
blaze, then, stealing a look at Essex over his shoulder,
saw that he was refilling his pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be&#8217;n to the funeral?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Essex grunted an assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The family there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None of the ladies; only Win Shackleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harney was silent; then, with the greatest care, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
took up a piece of coal and set it on the fire. The
action required all the ingenuity of which he was master.
His body responded to his intoxication, while,
save for an unusual fluency of speech, his mind appeared
to remain unaffected. After he had set the
coal in place he looked again at Essex, who was staring
vacantly at him, thinking of the second part of his
article.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice a tall, fine-looking young lady there
with dark red hair?&#8221; said Harney, without removing
his glassy gaze from the man at the table.</p>

<p>Essex did not move his eyes, but their absent fixity
suddenly seemed to snap into a change of focus betokening
attention. Gazing at Harney, he answered
coldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I saw no one like that. To whom are you
referring?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dunno, I dunno,&#8221; responded the other with
a clumsy shrug of his shoulders, and turning back to
the fire over which he cowered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know her anyhow,&#8221; he added, half to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do I know? Turn around.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man turned, looking a little defiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what are you trying to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t tryin&#8217; to say nuthin&#8217;. All I done is to ask
yer if yer saw a lady&mdash;tall, with red hair&mdash;at the funeral.
You know her, &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve seen you with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; slowly and uneasily, &#8220;she&#8217;s called Moreau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Miss Mariposa Moreau, the daughter of
a mining man, who died last spring in Santa Barbara?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>&#8220;Yes; that&#8217;s her all right. She&#8217;s called Moreau, but
it ain&#8217;t her name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreau isn&#8217;t her name? What is her name, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; he spoke stubbornly and turned back to
the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn back here,&#8221; said Essex in a suddenly authoritative
tone; &#8220;explain to me what you mean by that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean nuthin&#8217;,&#8221; said the other, looking sullenly
defiant, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t know nuthin&#8217; only that that
ain&#8217;t her true name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is her name? Answer me at once, and no
fooling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex rose. Harney, looking frightened, staggered
to his feet, clutching the mantelpiece. He half-raised
his arm as if expecting to be struck and said loudly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to know ask Shackleton&#8217;s widow.
<i>She</i> knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex stood a few paces from him, suddenly stilled
by the phrase. The drunkard, alarmed and yet defiant,
could only dimly understand what the expression
on the face of the man before him meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Essex quietly; &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to
touch you. I&#8217;m going to get some whisky. That&#8217;ll
tone you up a bit. The bronchitis has taken it out of
you more than you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to a cupboard and brought out a bottle and
glasses. Pouring some whisky into one, he pushed it
toward Harney.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that&#8217;ll brace you up. You&#8217;ll feel more yourself
in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>He diluted his own with water and only touched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
glass&#8217;s rim to his lips. His eyes, glistening and intent,
were on the drunkard&#8217;s now darkly flushing face. The
glass rattled against the table as Harney set it down.</p>

<p>&#8220;That puts mettle into me again. Makes me feel
like the old times before the malaria got into my bones.
Malaria was my ruin. Got it in the Sierra mining.
People think it&#8217;s drink that done it, but it&#8217;s malaria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was when you knew Moreau? What sort of
man was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor sort; not any grit. Had a good claim up
there beyond Placerville, he and I. Took out&#8217;s much
as eight thousand in that first summer. Moreau
stayed by it, but I quit. Both had our reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Miss Moreau, you say, is not Dan Moreau&#8217;s
daughter. Is she a step-daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;in a sort of a way you might say so. Anyway,
she ain&#8217;t got no legal right to that name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know the mother was a widow when she
married Moreau?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She weren&#8217;t. She married twict, and she weren&#8217;t
divorced. There ain&#8217;t but two people in the world
that knows it. One&#8217;s Jake Shackleton&#8217;s widow,&#8221;&mdash;he
rose, and, putting an unsteady hand on the table,
leaned forward and almost whispered into his interlocutor&#8217;s
face,&mdash;&#8220;and the other&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you trying to tell me,&#8221; said Essex quietly, &#8220;that
Miss Moreau is Jake Shackleton&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she is.&#8221; The man turned round like a
character on the stage and swept the room with an investigating
look&mdash;&#8220;And she&#8217;s more&#8217;n that. She&#8217;s his
lawful daughter, born in wedlock.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two faces stared at each other. The drunken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
man was not too far beyond himself to realize the importance
of what he was saying. In a second&#8217;s retrospect
Essex&#8217;s mind flew back over the hitherto puzzling
interest Shackleton had taken in Mariposa
Moreau. Could it be possible the man before him was
telling the truth?</p>

<p>&#8220;How does she come to be known as Moreau&#8217;s
daughter? Why didn&#8217;t Shackleton acknowledge her
if she was his legitimate child? That&#8217;s a fairy tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was complications. Have you ever heard
that Shackleton was once a Mormon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex had heard the gossip which had persistently
followed Shackleton&#8217;s ascending course. He nodded
his head, gazing at Harney, a presentiment of coming
revelations holding him silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true. He was. I seen him when he
was. Jake Shackleton crossed the Sierra with two
wives. One&mdash;the first one&mdash;was the lady who died
here a month ago, and passed as Mrs. Moreau. The
other&#8217;s the widow. But she was the second wife. She
didn&#8217;t have no children then. But the first wife had
one, a girl baby, born on the plains in Utah. It weren&#8217;t
three weeks old when I seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Sierra back of Hangtown. Me and Dan
Moreau was workin&#8217; a stream bed there. And one day
two emigrants, a man and a woman, with a sick woman
inside the wagon, came down from the summit. They
was Jake Shackleton and his two wives, and they was
the worst looking outfit you&#8217;ve ever clapped your eyes
on. They was pretty near dead. One er their horses
did die, in front of our cabin, and the sick woman&mdash;she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
that afterwards was called Mrs. Moreau&mdash;was too
beat out to move on. Shackleton, who didn&#8217;t care who
died, so long&#8217;s they got into the settlements, calkalated
to make her ride a spell, and when the other horse
dropped make her walk. She was the orneriest lookin&#8217;
scarecrow you ever seen, and she hadn&#8217;t no more
life&#8217;n a mummy. But she was ready to do just what
they said. She was just so beat out. And then
Moreau&mdash;he was just that kind of a fool&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked at Essex, with his beady, dark
eyes glistening with a sense of the importance of his
communication. His hand sought the glass and he
drained it. Then he leaned forward to deliver the
climax of his story:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bought her from Shackleton for a pair of horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bought her for a pair of horses! How could he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; how he could; I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; what he
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord knows. He was that kind of a fool. We
had her in the cabin sick for days, with me and him
waitin&#8217; on her hand and foot, and the cussed baby
yellin&#8217; like a coyote. She wasn&#8217;t good for anything.
Just ust ter lie round sick and peaked and sorter pine.
But Moreau got a crazy liking for her, and he was
sot on the baby same&#8217;s if it was his own. I caught
on pretty soon to the way the cat was goin&#8217; to jump.
I lit out and left &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you leave if the claim was good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It weren&#8217;t no good when no one worked it, and
there weren&#8217;t more&#8217;n enough in it for Moreau alone,
with a woman and a baby on his hands. He said first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
off he was only goin&#8217; to get her cured up and send her
to the Eldorado Hotel to be a waitress, but I seen fast
enough what was goin&#8217; to happen. And it did happen.
They was snowed in up there all winter. In the spring
he took her into Hangtown and married her&mdash;said he
was marryin&#8217; a widow woman whose husband died on
the plains. I heard that afterwards from some er the
boys, but it weren&#8217;t my business to give &#8217;em away. So
I shut my mouth and ain&#8217;t opened it till now. But
Moreau&#8217;s dead, and the woman&#8217;s dead, and now
Shackleton&#8217;s dead. There ain&#8217;t no one what knows but
me and Shackleton&#8217;s widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what makes you think this is the same child?
The baby you saw may have died and this may be a
child born a year or two later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the same. There weren&#8217;t never any
other children. I kep&#8217; my eye on &#8217;em. Moreau was
mining round among the camps and afterward was in
Sacramento for a spell, and I was round in them places
off and on myself. I saw him, but I dodged him
&#8217;cause I knew he didn&#8217;t want to run up against me,
knowin&#8217; as how I was onter what he&#8217;d done. He was
safe for me. But I seen the girl often; seen her grow
up. And I knew her in a minute the day I saw you
walkin&#8217; with her on Sutter Street, and I thinks to myself,
&#8216;You&#8217;re with the biggest heiress in San Francisco
if you and she only knew it.&#8217; And that&#8217;s what she is,
if there was somethin&#8217; else but my word to prove it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex sat pushed back from the table, his hands in
his pockets, his pipe nipped between his teeth, his face
partly obscured by the floating clouds of smoke that
hung about his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;A first-rate story,&#8221; he said slowly; &#8220;have some more
whisky.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he pushed the bottle toward Harney, who seized
it and fumblingly poured the fiery liquor into the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s true,&#8221; he said hoarsely&mdash;&#8220;every blamed
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drank what he had poured out, set down the
glass and stared at Essex with his face puckered into
its expression of evil cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>she</i> don&#8217;t know anything about it, does she?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean Miss Moreau, she certainly appears to
think she is the child of the man who brought her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I heard. But Shackleton, when
Moreau died, was goin&#8217; to do the square thing by her.
At least, I heard talk of his sendin&#8217; her to Europe to be
a singer. Ain&#8217;t it so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard something about it myself. But I&#8217;m no
authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Harney settled back in his
chair. The room was exceedingly hot, and impregnated
with the odor of whisky and the smoke from
Essex&#8217;s pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t acknowledge her. It would er given
the other children too big a black eye. But it seemed
like he wanted to square things up when he was taken
off suddent like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. The other, smoking, with frowning
brows and wide eyes, made no response, his own
thoughts holding him in tense immobility.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the other wife wouldn&#8217;t er stood it, anyway.
She&#8217;s a pretty competent woman, I guess. Oh, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
couldn&#8217;t have acknowledged her, nohow. But she&#8217;s
his legitimate daughter, all right. She&#8217;s the lawful
heir to&mdash;most er them&mdash;millions. She&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice broke and trailed off into silence, which
was suddenly interrupted by a guttural snort and then
heavy, regular breathing. Essex rose, and, going to
the window, opened it. A keen-edged breeze of air
entered, seeming all the fresher from the dense atmosphere
of the room. Its hurried entrance sent the
smoke wreaths scurrying about in fantastic whorls and
curls. The dying fire threw out a frightened flame.</p>

<p>Essex moved toward it, saying as he approached:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s a good story. You ought to be a novelist,
Harney.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no answer, and, looking into the chair, he
saw that Harney had fallen into a sodden sleep, curled
against the chair-back, his chin sunk on his breast, the
hollows in his face looking black in the hard light of
the gas. The younger man gazed at him for a moment
with an expression of slight, cold disgust, then
turned back to the table and sat down.</p>

<p>He wrote no more, but sat motionless, his eyes fixed
on vacancy, the thick, curling smoke oozing from the
bowl of his pipe and issuing from between his lips.
His thoughts reviewed every part of the story he had
heard. He felt certain of its truth. The drunken
job-printer had never imagined it.</p>

<p>It explained many things that before had puzzled
him. Why the Moreaus, even in the days of their
affluence, had lived in such uneventful quietude, bringing
up their beautiful and talented daughter in a jealous
and unusual seclusion. It explained Shackleton&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
interest in the girl. He even saw now, recalling the
two faces, the likeness that the father himself had
seen in Mariposa&#8217;s firmly-modeled jaw and chin, which
did not belong to the soft, feminine prettiness of Lucy.</p>

<p>It must be true.</p>

<p>And, being true, what possibilities might it not develop?
Mrs. Shackleton knew it, too&mdash;that this penniless
girl was the bonanza king&#8217;s eldest and only
legitimate child, with power, if not entirely to dispossess
her own children, at least to claim the lion&#8217;s share
of the vast fortune. If Mariposa had proof of her
mother&#8217;s marriage to Shackleton and of her own identity
as the child of that marriage, she could rise and
claim her heritage&mdash;her part of the twenty millions!</p>

<p>The thought, and what it opened before him, dizzied
him. He drank some of the diluted whisky in the
glass beside him and sat on motionless. It was evident
Mariposa did not know. She had been brought
up in ignorance of the whole extraordinary story. The
man and woman she had been taught to regard as her
parents had committed an offense against the law,
which they had hidden from her, secure in the thought
that the other participants in the strange proceeding
would never dare to confess.</p>

<p>The minutes and hours ticked by and Essex still sat
thinking, while the drunkard breathed stertorously in
his heavy sleep, and the coals dropped softly in the
grate as the fire sank into clinkers and ashes.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Shackleton was sufficiently recovered,
the family had moved from Menlo Park to their
town house.</p>

<p>The long work of settling up the great estate which
had been left to the widow and her children, required
their presence in the city, and the shock which Bessie
had suffered in finding her husband dead, had rendered
the country place unbearable to her.</p>

<p>The day after the funeral the women had moved to
town. Win, however, remained at Menlo Park, to go
over such documents of his father&#8217;s as had been left
there. Shackleton had lived so much at his country
place for the last two or three years that many of
his papers and letters were kept in the library, which
had been his especial sanctum.</p>

<p>Among these, the son had come upon a small package
of letters, which, fastened together with an elastic,
and bearing a note of their contents on one end, had
roused his interest. They were the letters exchanged
between his father and the chief of the detective bureau
when the latter had been commissioned to locate the
widow and daughter of Daniel Moreau.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>Shackleton, a man of exceedingly methodical habits,
had kept copies of his letters. There were only seven of
them altogether&mdash;three from him; four in reply. The
first ones were short, only a few lines, containing the
request to find the ladies who, the writer understood,
were in San Francisco, and ascertain their circumstances
and position. Then came the acknowledgment
of that, and then in a few days, the answer stating the
whereabouts of Mrs. Moreau and her daughter, their
means, and such small facts about them as that the
mother was in delicate health and the daughter &#8220;a
handsome, accomplished, and estimable young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>Win looked over this correspondence, puzzled and
wondering. He remembered the girl he had seen in
<i>The Trumpet</i> office that dark afternoon, and how the
office boy had told him it was a Miss Moreau, a friend
of Mrs. Willers, and a singer. What motive could his
father have had in seeking out this girl and her mother
in this secret and effectual way? He read over the
letters again. Moreau had died in Santa Barbara in
the spring, the widow and her daughter had then
come to San Francisco, and by the wording of the
second letter he inferred that his father had been ignorant
of their means, and of the girl&#8217;s appearance,
style and character. It was evidently not the result
of an interest in people he had once known and then
lost sight of. It seemed to be an interest, for some
outside reason, in two women of whom he knew absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>Win had heard that his father contemplated offering
a musical education to some singing girl, of whom
the young man knew nothing, and had seen only for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
moment that day in <i>The Trumpet</i> office. This was undoubtedly
the girl. But Shackleton evidently had not
heard of her through Mrs. Willers, who was known
to be an energetic boomer of obscure genius. He had
hunted her out himself; had undoubtedly had some
ulterior interest in, or knowledge of her some time before
the day Win had seen her. It was odd, the boy
thought, meditating over the correspondence. What
could have led his father to search for, and then attempt
to assist, a woman who seemed to be a complete
stranger to him? It looked like the secret paying of
an old debt.</p>

<p>Win put the letters in his pocket and went up to
town. There was more work for him to do now than
there had ever been before, and he rose to it with a
spirit and energy that surprised himself. Neither he
nor any one else had ever realized how paralyzing to
him had been his father&#8217;s cold scorn. From boyhood,
Win had felt himself to be an aggravating failure.
The elder man had not scrupled to make him understand
his inferiority. The mere presence of his father
seemed to numb his brain and make his tongue stammer
over the simplest phrases. Now, he felt himself
free and full of energy, as though bands that had
cramped his mind and confined his body were broken.
His old attitude of posing as a fast young man of
fashion lost its charm. Life grew suddenly to mean
something, to be full of use and purpose.</p>

<p>He was left very much to himself, his mother being
still too much broken to attend to business, and Maud
being absorbed in her affair with Latimer, which had
recently culminated in a secret engagement. This she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
had been afraid to tell to her domineering father and
ambitious mother, and her opportunities of seeing her
fianc&eacute; had been of the briefest until now. Latimer
haunted the house of evenings, when Bessie was lying
on the sofa in an upstairs boudoir and Win was locked
in his father&#8217;s study going over the interminable documents.</p>

<p>The first darkness of her grief and horror past, Bessie,
in her seclusion, thought of many things. One of
these was the fate of Mariposa Moreau. The bonanza
king&#8217;s widow, with all her faults, had that lavish and
reckless generosity, where money was concerned, that
marked the early Californians. This forceful woman,
who had made the blighting journey across the plains
without complaint, faced the fierce hardships of her
early married life with a smile, borne her children amid
the rude discomforts of remote mining camps, was
an adept in the art of luxurious living. She knew
by instinct how to be magnificent, and one of her magnificences
was the careless munificence of her generosity.</p>

<p>Now, she felt for Mariposa. She knew Shackleton&#8217;s
plans for her, and realized the girl&#8217;s disappointment.
In her heart she had been bitterly jealous of the other
wife&#8217;s child, who had the beauty and gifts her own
lacked. It would be to everybody&#8217;s advantage to remove
the girl to another country and sphere. And
because her husband had died there was no reason
why his plans should remain unfulfilled. Though
Shackleton had assured her that the girl knew nothing,
though every one connected with the shameful bargain
but herself was dead, it was best to be prudent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
especially when prudence was the course most agreeable
to all concerned. She would rest easier; her children
would seem more secure in their positions and
possessions, if Mariposa Moreau, well provided for,
were safe in Paris studying singing.</p>

<p>When she was fully decided as to the wisdom of
her course, she wrote Mariposa a short but friendly
letter, speaking of her knowledge of Mr. Shackleton&#8217;s
plans for her advancement, of her desire to carry out
her late husband&#8217;s wishes, and naming a day and hour
at which she begged the young girl to call on her. It
was a simple matter to ascertain Miss Moreau&#8217;s address
from Mrs. Willers, and the letter was duly sent.</p>

<p>It roused wrath in its recipient. Mariposa was learning
worldly wisdom at a rate of which her tardy development
had not given promise. Great changes were
taking place in her simple nature. She had been
wakened to life with savage abruptness. Dormant
characteristics, passions unsuspected, had risen to the
surface. The powerful feelings of a rich, but undeveloped
womanhood had suddenly been shaken from
their sleep by a grip of the hand of destiny. The unfamiliarity
of a bitter anger against the Shackletons
struggled with the creeping disgust of Essex, that
grew daily.</p>

<p>Morning after morning she woke when the first gray
light was faintly defining the squares of the windows.
The leaden sense of wretchedness that seemed to draw
her out of sleep, gave place to the living hatred and
shame that the upheaval of her life had left behind.
She watched the golden wheat-ears dimly glimmering
on the pale walls, while she lay and thought of all she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
had learned of life, her faith and happy ignorance destroyed
forever.</p>

<p>Six weeks ago Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s letter would have
represented no more to her than what its words expressed.
Now, she saw Bessie&#8217;s anxiety to be rid of
her, to push her out of sight as a menace. How much
more readily would the widow have gone to work,
with what zest of alarm and energy, would she have
contrived for her expulsion, had she guessed what
Mariposa knew. The girl vacillated for a day, hating
the thought of an interview with any member of the
family whose wrongs to her beloved mother were
seared scars in her brain; but finally concluding that
it would be better to end her connection with them by
an interview with Mrs. Shackleton, she answered the
letter, stating that she would come at the appointed
hour.</p>

<p>Two days later, at the time set in the afternoon, she
stood in the small reception-room, to the left of the
wide marble hall, waiting. The hushed splendor of
the house would have impressed and awed her at any
other time. But to-day her heart beat loud and her
brain was preoccupied with its effort to keep her purpose
clear, and yet not to be angered into revealing
too much. The vast lower floor was loftier and more
spacious than anything she had ever seen before.
There were glimpses through many doors, and artificial
elongations of perspective by means of mirrors.
The long receding vista was touched with gleams
of light on parquet flooring, reflections on the gray
surfaces of mirrors, the curves of porcelain vases, the
bosses of gilded frames. Over all hung the scent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
flowers, that were massed here and there in Chinese
bowls.</p>

<p>Bessie&#8217;s step, and the accompanying rustle of brushing
silks, brought the girl to her feet, rigid and cold.
The widow swept into the room with extended hand.
She was richly and correctly garbed in lusterless
black, that sent out the nervous whisperings of crushed
silks and exhaled a faint perfume. It was impossible
to ignore the hand, and Mariposa touched it with her
own for a minute. She had seen Bessie only once
before, on the evening of the opera. The change
wrought in her by grief and illness was noticeable.
Her fine, healthy color had faded; her eyes were darkened,
and there were many deep lines on her forehead
and about her mouth. Nevertheless, a casual eye
would have still noticed her as a woman of vigor,
mental and physical. It was easy to understand how
she had stood shoulder to shoulder with her husband
in his fight for fortune.</p>

<p>She motioned Mariposa to a chair facing the window,
and studied her as she glibly accomplished the
commonplaces of greeting. Her heart drew together
with a renewed spasm of jealousy as she noted the
girl&#8217;s superiority to her own daughter. What subtly
finer qualities had Lucy had, that her child should be
thus distinguished from the other children of Jake
Shackleton? The indignation working against this
woman gave a last touch of stateliness to poor Mariposa&#8217;s
natural dignity of demeanor. She seemed to
belong, by nature and birth, to these princely surroundings,
which completely dwarfed Maud, and even made
the adaptive Bessie look common.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;My husband,&#8221; said the elder woman, when the beginnings
of the conversation were disposed of, &#8220;was
very much interested in you. He knew your father,
Dan Moreau, very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa was becoming used to this phrase and
could listen to it without the stare of surprise, or the
blush of consciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Mr. Shackleton told me,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&#8221;&mdash;Bessie looked down at the deeply-bordered
handkerchief in her hand&mdash;&#8220;was a man of
great kindliness and generosity. Mr. Shackleton knew
him in the Sierras, mining, a long time ago, when he&#8221;&mdash;she
paused, not from embarrassment, but in order to
choose her words carefully&mdash;&#8220;was very kind to my husband
and others of our party. It was an obligation
Mr. Shackleton never forgot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa could make no answer. Shackleton had
never spoken to her with this daring. Bessie looked
at her for a response, and saw her with her eyes on
the ground, pale and slightly frowning. She wanted
to sweep away any possible suspicion from the girl&#8217;s
mind by making her understand that the attitude of
the family toward her rose from gratitude for a past
benefit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shackleton,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;often talked to
me about his plans for you. He wanted to have you
study in Paris, under some teacher Lepine spoke to him
about. I understand you&#8217;ve got a remarkable voice.
I wanted, several times, to hear you, but it couldn&#8217;t
seem to be managed, living in the country, and always
so busy. In his sudden&mdash;passing away, all these plans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
came to an end. He hadn&#8217;t regularly arranged anything.
There were such a lot of delays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa nodded, then feeling that she must say
something, she murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother died. I was not well, and I couldn&#8217;t
see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly, I understand just how it was. And it
wasn&#8217;t a bit fair, that simply because you didn&#8217;t happen
to be able to go to the office at that time, you should
lose your chance of a musical education and all that
might have come out of it. Now, Miss Moreau, it&#8217;s
my intention to carry out my husband&#8217;s wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at Mariposa, not smiling, nor condescending,
but with a hard earnestness. The girl raised
her eyes and the two glances met.</p>

<p>&#8220;His wishes with regard to me?&#8221; said Mariposa, with
a questioning inflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. I want you to go to Paris, as he wanted
you to go. I want you to study to be a singer. I&#8217;ll
pay it all&mdash;education, masters, and a monthly sum for
living besides. I don&#8217;t think, from what I hear, that it
would be necessary for you to study more than two or
three years. Then you would make your appearance
as a grand opera prima donna, or concert singer, as
your teachers thought fit. I don&#8217;t know much about
it, but I believe they can&#8217;t always tell about a voice
right off at the start. Anyway, I&#8217;d see to it that yours
got every chance for the best development.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;afraid it will be impossible,&#8221; said Mariposa,
in a low voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; exclaimed the elder woman, sitting
upright in her surprise. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa had come to the house of Mrs. Shackleton
burning with a sense of the wrongs her mother had
suffered at the hands of this woman and her dead
husband. She had thought little of what the interview
would be like, and now, with the keen, hard, and astonished
eyes of Bessie upon her, she felt that something
more than pride and indignation must help her
through. The world&#8217;s diplomacy of tongue and brain
was an unsuspected art to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; she stammered irresolutely, &#8220;have changed
my mind since I talked with Mr. Shackleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Changed your mind! But why? What&#8217;s made you
change your mind in so short a time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many things,&#8221; said the girl, with her face flushing
deeply under Bessie&#8217;s unflinching stare. &#8220;There have
been changes&mdash;in&mdash;in&mdash;circumstances&mdash;and in me. My
mother was anxious for my advancement. Now she
is dead and&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was certainly not a brilliant way out of the difficulty.
A faint smile wrinkled the loose skin round
Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear,&#8221; she said, with a slight touch of impatience
in her voice. &#8220;If that&#8217;s all, I guess we needn&#8217;t
worry about it. People die, and we lose our energies
and ambition, so we just want to lie round and mourn.
But at your age that don&#8217;t last long. You&#8217;ve got to
make your future yourself, and now&#8217;s your chance.
It just comes once or twice in a lifetime, and the people
who get there are the people who know enough to
snatch it as it comes by.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>Mariposa&#8217;s irresolution had passed. She realized
that she had not merely to state her intentions, but to
fight a will unused to defeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go,&#8221; she said quietly; &#8220;I understand that
all you say is perfectly true. You probably think I
am silly and ungrateful. I don&#8217;t think I am either,
but that&#8217;s because I know what I feel. I thank you
very much, but I can&#8217;t accept it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet. Bessie saw that she was pale&mdash;evidently
agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; she said, indicating the chair again.
&#8220;Now let me hear your reasons, my dear girl. People
don&#8217;t throw up the chance of a lifetime for nothing.
What&#8217;s behind all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Mariposa said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to accept it. I don&#8217;t want to take the
money or be under any obligation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were willing to be under the obligation, as
you call it, a few weeks ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie&#8217;s voice was as cold as steel. From the moment
she had entered the room she had felt an instinctive
antagonism between herself and her husband&#8217;s eldest
child. It would become a hatred in time. The
girl&#8217;s slow and reluctant way of speaking seemed to
indicate that she expressed herself with difficulty, like
one who, under pressure, tells the truth.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother wanted me to accept anything that was
for my own benefit. Now she is dead. I am my own
mistress. I grieve or hurt no one but myself if I refuse
your offer. And, as things are now, it is better
for me to refuse it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;as things are now&#8217;? Has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
anything happened to change your ideas since my
husband first made the suggestion to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa told her lie as a woman does, with reservations.
It was creditably done, for it was the first
lie she had ever told in her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing has actually happened, but&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have
changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you going to let a girl&#8217;s whims stand in
the way of your future success in life? I can&#8217;t believe
that. My dear, you&#8217;re handsome and you&#8217;ve a fine
voice, but do you think those two things, without a
cent behind them, are going to put you on top of the
heap? You&#8217;re not the woman to get there without a
lot of boosting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I want to get on top of the heap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you <i>want</i> to stay at the bottom&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Shackleton gave a shrug and rose to her feet.
The girl was incomprehensible. She was either very
subtile and deep, or she was extraordinarily dull and
shallow. Shackleton had said to her once that she
seemed to him childish and undeveloped, for her age.
The woman&#8217;s keen eye saw deeper. If Mariposa was
not disingenuous, she would always, on the side of
shrewdness and worldly wisdom, be undeveloped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear,&#8221; she said coldly, &#8220;it all rests with
yourself. But I can&#8217;t, conscientiously, let you throw
your best chances away. We won&#8217;t speak of this any
more to-day. But go home and think about it, and in
a week or two let me know what conclusion you&#8217;ve
come to. Don&#8217;t ever throw a chance away, even if
you don&#8217;t happen to like the person who offers it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave Mariposa a shrewd and good-natured smile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
The girl, her face crimsoning, was about to answer,
when the hall door opened, and, with a sound of laughter
and a whiff of violets, Maud and the Count de Lamolle
entered the room.</p>

<p>In her heavy mourning, Maud looked more nearly
pretty than she had ever done before. It was not the
dress that beautified her, but the happiness of her engagement
to Latimer, with whom she was deeply in
love, which had lent her the fleeting grace and charm
that only love, well bestowed, can give. She carried a
large bunch of violets in her hand, and her face was
slightly flushed.</p>

<p>The count, who had attentively read the will of Jake
Shackleton in the papers, was staying on in San Francisco.
His attentions to Maud were not more assiduous,
but they were more &#8220;serious,&#8221; to use the technical
phrase, than heretofore. She would make him an ideal
wife, he thought. Even her lack of beauty was an
advantage. When an American girl was both rich
and pretty, she was more than even the most tactful
and sophisticated Frenchman could manage. Maud,
ugly, gentle, and not clever, would be a delightful
wife, ready to love humbly, unexacting, easy to make
happy.</p>

<p>The count, a handsome, polished Parisian, speaking
excellent English, bowed over Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s
hand, and then, in answer to her words of introduction,
shot an exploring look, warmed by a glimmer
of discreet admiration, at Mariposa. He wondered
who she was, for his practised eye took in at a glance
that she was shabbily dressed and evidently not of the
world of bonanza millions. He wished that he knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
her, now that he had made up his mind to spend some
months in San Francisco, paying court to the heiress
who would make him such an admirable wife, and in
whose society time hung so heavily on his hands.</p>

<p>Mariposa excused herself and hurried away. She
was angry and confused. It seemed to her she had
done nothing but be rude and obstinately stupid, while
the cold and composed older woman had eyed her
with wary attentiveness. What did Mrs. Shackleton
think she had meant? She felt that the widow had
not, for a moment, abandoned the scheme of sending
her away. Descending the wide steps in the early
dark, the girl realized that the woman she had just left
was not going to be beaten from her purpose by what
appeared a girl&#8217;s unreasonable caprice.</p>

<p>A man coming up the steps brushed by her, paused
for a moment, and then mechanically raised his hat.
In the gleam of the lamps, held aloft at the top of the
flight, she recognized the thin face and eye-glasses of
Win Shackleton. She did not return the salute, as it
was completely unexpected, and from the foot of the
stairs she heard the hall door bang behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that girl I met on the steps just now,
going out?&#8221; Win asked his mother, as they went upstairs
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;That Miss Moreau your father was interested in.
He was going to send her to Paris to learn singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was she doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent for her. I wanted to talk over things with
her. I intended sending her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you fix it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; with a little laugh, &#8220;she&#8217;s a very changeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
young woman. She says she doesn&#8217;t want to go now;
that she&#8217;s come to the conclusion she doesn&#8217;t want to
be under the obligation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny,&#8221; said Win. &#8220;She must be sort of
original. Mommer, why did the governor want to
send her to Paris? What was it made him so interested
in her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knew her father long ago, mining, in the Sierra,
and Moreau did him a good turn up there. Your father
had never forgotten it and was anxious to repay it by
helping the daughter. She don&#8217;t seem to be easy to
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Win, as he dressed for dinner, meditated on his
mother&#8217;s explanation. It sounded reasonable enough,
only a thirst to repay past obligations was not&mdash;according
to his experience and memories&mdash;a peculiarity
that had troubled his father. Both he and Maud knew
that all the generosities and charities of the household
had been inspired by their mother. His childish memory
was stocked by recollections of her urging the
advantage of the bestowal of pecuniary aid to this and
that person, association and charity. It was she who
had saved Jake Shackleton from the accusation of
meanness, which California society invariably makes
against its rich men.</p>

<p>To the astonishment of his world, Win Shackleton
announced his intention of retaining <i>The Trumpet</i>,
and conducting it, himself, on the lines laid down by
his father. There was a slight shifting of positions, in
which some were advanced and one or two heads were
unexpectedly lopped off and thrown in the basket. The
new ruler took control with a decision that startled
those who had regarded him as a typical millionaire&#8217;s
son. The men on the paper, who had seen the time
of their lives coming in the managership of a feeble
and inexperienced boy, were awakened from their
dreams by feeling a hand on the reins, as tight as that
of Jake Shackleton himself. Win had ideas. Mrs.
Willers was advanced to the managership of the Woman&#8217;s
Page, into which she swept triumphant, with Miss
Peebles, the young woman of the &#8220;Foibles and Fancies&#8221;
column, in her wake. Barry Essex was lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
to a staff position, at a high salary, and had to himself
one of the little cells that branch off the main passage.</p>

<p>Here he worked hard, for Win permitted no drones
in his hive. The luck was with Essex, as it had been
often before in his varied career. Things had fallen
together exactly as they should for the furthering of
his designs. It would take a long wooing to win over
Mariposa. Now, he could save money against the
day when he and she would leave together for the
Europe where they were to conquer fame and fortune.</p>

<p>He had had other talks with Harney since the evening
of his revelation. He was convinced that the man
was telling the truth. He had known men before of
Harney&#8217;s type and wondered why the drunkard had
not made use of his knowledge for his own advancement.
He had evidently kept his eye on both Shackleton
and Moreau, and it was strange, that, as the two
men rose to affluence, he had not used the ugly secret
he held. The only explanation of it was that they held
an even greater power over him. He had undoubtedly
had reason to fear both men. Shackleton, once
arrived at the pinnacle of his success, would have
crushed like a beetle in his path this drunken threatener
of his peace. Moreau, whose every movement he
seemed to have followed, had evidently had a hold over
him. Hold or no hold, Shackleton would have swept
him aside by the power of his money and his position,
into the oblivion that awaits the enemies of rich and
unscrupulous men.</p>

<p>Now both were dead. But the day of Harney&#8217;s
power was over. Enfeebled in mind and body by
drink and disease, he had neither the force nor the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
brain to be dangerous. His uses were merely those
of an instrument in daring hands. And those hands
had found him. There were long talks in Essex&#8217;s
room in the evenings, during which the story was
threshed out. George Harney, drunk or sober, neither
contradicted himself nor varied in his details. His
mind, confused and addled on other matters, retained
this memory with unblurred clearness.</p>

<p>So Essex deliberated, carefully and without haste,
for there was plenty of time.</p>

<p>The bright days continued. On a radiant Saturday
afternoon, Mariposa, tired with a morning&#8217;s teaching,
started forth to spend an hour or two in the park. She
had done this several times before, finding the green
peace and solitude of that beautiful spot soothing to
her harassed spirit. It was a long ride in those days,
and this had its charm, the little steam dummy cresting
the tops of sandy hills, clothed with lupins and
tiny frightened oaks, crouching before the sea winds.
On this occasion she had invited the escort of Benito,
who had been hanging drearily about the house, thinking
with mingled triumph and envy of Miguel, who
had gone with his mother to have a tooth pulled out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pulling the tooth&#8217;s bad, of course,&#8221; Benito had
said to Mariposa, as he trotted by her side to the car,
&#8220;but then afterward there&#8217;s candy. I dunno but what
it&#8217;s worth while. And then you have the tooth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the tooth!&#8221; said Mariposa. &#8220;What do you
want the tooth for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can show it to the boys in school, and you can
generally trade it. I traded mine for a knife with two
blades, but both of &#8217;em was broke.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Benito was becoming very friendly with Mariposa.
He was a cheerful and expansive soul. Could they have
heard him, Uncle Gam and his mother might have
suffered some embarrassment on the score of his revelations
as to their quarrels concerning his upbringing.
Benito had thoroughly gaged the capacity of
each of them in resisting his charms and urging
him to higher and better things. He was already at
the stage when his mother appealed slightly to his
commiseration and largely to his sense of humor. Mariposa
saw that while he had grasped the great fact that
his Uncle Gam had an unfortunately soft heart, he
also knew there was a stage when it was resolutely
hardened and his most practised wiles fell baffled from
its surface.</p>

<p>They alighted from the car at what was then the
main entrance, and, side by side, Benito fluently talking,
made toward the gate. Here a peanut vender
had artfully placed his stall, and the fumes from the
roasted nuts rose gratefully to the nostrils of the small
boy. He said nothing, but sniffed with an ostentatious
noise, and then looked sidewise at Mariposa. One of
the sources of his respect for her was that she was so
quick in reading the language of the eye. One did
not vulgarly have to demand things of her. He felt
the nickel in his hand and galloped off to the stand, to
return slowly, his head on one side, an eye investigating
the contents of the opened paper bag he carried.</p>

<p>Being a gentleman of gallant forbears, he offered
this to Mariposa, listening with some uneasiness to
the scraping of her fingers among its contents. He
had an awful thought that she might be like Miguel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
who could never be trusted to withdraw his hand until
it was full to bursting. But Mariposa&#8217;s eventually
emerged with one small nut between thumb and finger.
This she nibbled gingerly as they passed under the
odorous, dark shade of the cypresses. Benito spread
a trail of shells behind him, dragging his feet in silent
happiness, his eyes fixed on the brilliant prospect of
sunlit green that filled in the end of the vista like a
drop-curtain.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the cypress shadows the
lawns and shrubberies of the park lay before them radiantly
vivid in their variegated greens. The scene
suggested a picture in its motionless beauty, the sunlight
sleeping on stretches of shaven turf where the
peacocks strutted, the red dust of the drive unstirred
by wind or wheel. Rich earth scents mingled with the
perfume of the winter blossoms, delicate breaths of
violets from beneath the trees, spices exhaled by belated
roses still bravely blossoming in November, and
now and then a whiff of the acrid, animal odor of the
eucalyptus.</p>

<p>Following pathways, now damp beneath the shade
of melancholy spruce and pine, now hard and dry between
velvety lawns, they came out on a large circular
opening. Here Mariposa sat down on a bench, with her
back to a sheltering mass of fir and hemlock, the
splendid sunshine pouring on her. Benito, with his
bag in his hand, trotted off to the grassy slope opposite
where custom has ordained that little boys may
roll about and play. He had hardly settled himself
there to the further enjoyment of his nuts when another
little boy appeared and made friendly overtures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
with his eyes on the bag. Mariposa could not hear
them, but she could see the first advance and Benito&#8217;s
somewhat wary eyings of the stranger. In a few moments
the formalities of introduction were over, and
they were both lying on their stomachs on the grass,
kicking gently with their toes, while the bag stood
between them.</p>

<p>Mariposa had intended to read, but her book lay
unopened in her lap. The sun in California is something
more than warming and cheerful. It is medicinal.
There is some unnamed balm in its light that
soothes the tormented spirit and rests and revivifies
the wearied body. It is at once a stimulant and a
sedative. It seems to have sucked up healing breaths
from the resinous forests inland and to be exhaling
them again upon those who can not seek their aid.</p>

<p>As the soothing rays enveloped her, Mariposa felt
the strain of mind and body relax and a sense of rest
suffuse her. She stretched herself into a more reposeful
attitude, one arm thrown along the back of the
bench. Her book lay beside her on the seat. To
keep the blinding light from her eyes she tilted her hat
forward till the shade of its brim cut cleanly across the
middle of her face.</p>

<p>Her mouth, which was plainly in view, had the expression
of suffering that is acquired by the mouths
of those who have been forced to endure suddenly and
silently. Her thoughts reverted to Essex and the
scene in the cottage. She wondered if the smart and
shame of it would ever lessen&mdash;if she would ever see
him again, and what he would say. She could not
imagine him as anything but master of himself. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
he was no longer master of her. The subtile spell he
had once exercised was forever broken.</p>

<p>She heard a foot on the gravel, but did not look up;
several people had passed close to her crossing to the
main drive. The new-comer advanced toward her idly,
noting the grace of her attitude, the rich and yet elegant
proportions of her figure. Her face was turned
from him, but he saw the roll of rust-colored hair
beneath her hat, started, and quickened his pace. He
had come to a halt beside her before she looked up
startled. A quick red rushed into her face. He, for
his part, stood suave and smiling, holding his hat in
one hand, no expression on his face but one of frank
pleasure. Even in his eyes there was not a shade of
consciousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a piece of luck!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Who&#8217;d have
thought of meeting you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa had nothing to respond. In a desperate
desire for flight and protection she looked for Benito,
but he was at the top of the slope, well out of earshot
of anything but a scream.</p>

<p>Essex surveyed her face with fond attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking better than you did before you
moved,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you were just a little too pale then.
You know, I didn&#8217;t know it was you at all. I was
looking at you as I came across the drive, and I hadn&#8217;t
the least idea it was you till I saw your hair&#8221;&mdash;his
eye lighted on it caressingly&mdash;&#8220;I knew there was only
one woman in San Francisco with hair like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice seemed to mesmerize her at first. Now her
volition came back and she rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benito!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;come at once.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>The two little boys had their heads close together
and neither turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to go for?&#8221; said Essex in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a question!&#8221; she said, picking up her book
with a trembling hand, and thinking in her ignorance
that he spoke honestly; &#8220;what an insulting question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Insulting! What on earth do you mean by that?&#8221;
coaxingly. &#8220;Please tell me why you are going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t want ever to see you or speak to
you again,&#8221; she said in a voice shaken with anger. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t have believed any man could be so lacking
in decency as&mdash;as&mdash;to do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; he asked with an air of blank surprise.
&#8220;What am I doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thrusting yourself on me this way when&mdash;when&mdash;you
know that the sight of you is humiliating and hateful
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mariposa!&#8221; he said softly. He looked into
her face with eyes brimming with teasing tenderness.
&#8220;How can you say that to me when my greatest fault
has been to love you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love me!&#8221; she ejaculated with breathless scorn;
&#8220;love me! Oh, Benito,&#8221;&mdash;calling with all her force&mdash;&#8220;come;
do come. I want you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Benito, who undoubtedly must have heard, was too
pleasantly engaged with the companionship of his
new friend to make any response. Early in life he had
learned the value of an occasional attack of deafness.</p>

<p>Mariposa made a motion to go to him, but Essex
gently moved in front of her. She drew away from
him, knitting her brows in helpless, heated rage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;You know you&#8217;re treating me very badly,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Treating you very badly,&#8221; she now fairly gasped,
once more a bewildered fly in the net of this subtile
spider, &#8220;how else should I treat you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kindly,&#8221; he said, softly bending his compelling
glance on her, &#8220;as a woman treats a man who loves
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Essex,&#8221; she said, turning on him with all the
dignity she had at her command, &#8220;we don&#8217;t seem to
understand each other. The last time I saw you, you
insulted and humiliated me. I don&#8217;t know how it can
be, but you seem to have forgotten all about it. I
haven&#8217;t. I never can, and I don&#8217;t want to see you or
speak to you or think of you ever again in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think I&#8217;ve forgotten?&#8221; he said,
suddenly dropping his voice to a key that thrilled with
meaning.</p>

<p>He saw the remark shake her into startled half-comprehension.
That she still took his words at their
face value proved to him again how strangely simple
she was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think I&#8217;ve forgotten?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes in arrested astonishment and
met his, now seeming suddenly to have become charged
with memories of the scene in the cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I forget?&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Do you
really think I could ever forget that evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned away speechless with embarrassment
and anger, recollections of the kisses of that ill-omened
interview burning in her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;When a man wounds the one woman in the world
he cares for, can he ever forget, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>He again had the gratification of seeing her flash a
look of artless surprise at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&#8221; she stammered, completely bewildered,
&#8220;if you know that you wounded me so, why do
you come back? Why do you speak to me now?
There is nothing more to be said between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is; much more.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back, frowning, on the alert to go. For a
second he thought he was to lose this precious and
unlooked-for chance of righting himself with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he said entreatingly; &#8220;sit down; I must
speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned from him and sent a quick glance toward
Benito. She was going.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa,&#8221; he said, desperately catching at her
arm, &#8220;please&mdash;a moment. Give me one moment. You
<i>must</i> listen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to draw her arm away, but he held it, and
pleaded, genuine feeling flushing his face and roughening
his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg&mdash;I implore&mdash;of you to listen to me. I only
ask a moment. Don&#8217;t condemn me without hearing
what I have to say. I behaved like a blackguard. I
know it. It&#8217;s haunted me ever since. Sit down and
listen to me while I try to explain and make you forgive
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was really stirred; the sincerity of his appeal
touched the heart, once so warm, now grown so cold
toward him. She sat down on the bench, at the end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
farthest from him, her whole bearing suggesting self-contained
aloofness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I shocked and hurt you. I know it&#8217;s just
and natural for you to treat me this way. I was mad.
I didn&#8217;t know what I was saying. If you knew how I
have suffered since you would at least have some pity
for me. Can you guess what it means to give a blow
to the being who is more to you than all the rest of the
world? I was mad for that one evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, looking at her. Her profile was toward
him, pale and immovable. She neither turned nor
spoke. He continued with a slight diminution of confidence:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a wild sort of fellow, consorting with all
sorts of riffraff and thinking lightly of women. I&#8217;ve
met lots of all kinds. It was all right to talk to them
that way. You were different. I knew it from the
first. But that night in the cottage I lost my head.
You looked so pale and sad; my love broke the bonds
I had put upon it. Can&#8217;t you understand and forgive
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned toward her, his face tense and pale. As
he became agitated and fell into the position of pleader,
she grew calm and regained her hold on herself. There
was a chill poise about her that frightened him. He
felt that if he attempted to touch her she would draw
away with quick, instinctive repugnance.</p>

<p>She turned and looked into his face with cold eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t think I understand. I should think
those very things you mention would appeal to the
chivalry of a man even if he didn&#8217;t care for a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you doubt that I love you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, turning away; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that
you ever could love me or any other woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked out over the grassy slope in front of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you don&#8217;t understand the first principles
of it. When you&#8217;re fond of people you don&#8217;t want
to hurt and humiliate them. You don&#8217;t want to drag
them down to shame and misery. You&#8217;d die to save
them from those things. You want to protect them,
help them, take care of them, be proud of them and
say to all the world: &#8216;Here, look; this is the person
I love!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her simplicity, that once would have amused him,
now had something in it that at once touched and
alarmed him. There was a downright conviction in
it, that argument, eloquence, passion even, would not
be able to shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that, Mariposa,&#8221; he said, ardently, &#8220;is the way
I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the way!&#8221; she echoed scornfully. &#8220;No&mdash;your
way is to ask me to destroy myself, body and soul.
You ask me to give you everything, while you give
nothing. You say you love me, and yet you&#8217;re so
ashamed of me and your love, that it would have to be
a hateful secret thing, that you told lies about, and
would expect me to tell lies about, too. I can&#8217;t understand
how you can dare to call it love. I can&#8217;t understand.
Oh, don&#8217;t talk about it any more. It&#8217;s all too
horrible and cruel and false!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words still further alarmed the man. He knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
they were not those of a woman swayed by sentiment,
far less by passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all true,&#8221; he said hastily, &#8220;that&#8217;s all true of
what I said to you that night in the cottage. Now it&#8217;s
different. Aren&#8217;t you large-hearted enough to forgive
a man whose greatest weakness has been his infatuation
for you? I was a ruffian and you an unsuspecting
angel. Now I want to offer you the only kind of love
that ever should be offered you. Will you be my
wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa started perceptibly. She turned and looked
with amazed eyes into his face. He seemed another
man from the one who had so bitterly humiliated her
at their last interview. He was pale and in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said with slow decisiveness, &#8220;I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he exclaimed, in loud-voiced incredulity and
bending his head to look into her face. &#8220;No?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she reiterated; &#8220;I said no.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt with every moment that their positions were
changing more and more. She was gradually ascending
to the command, while he was slowly coming under
her will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say no?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I want to say no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;why? Are you still angry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to say no,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say
anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you love me?&#8221; with angry persistence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re not telling
the truth. You do love me. You know you do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>She looked at him with cold defiance, and said steadily:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew nearer her along the bench and said with
his eyes hard upon her:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you were the kind of woman to kiss a
man you didn&#8217;t care for.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew when he spoke the words they were foolish
and jeopardized his cause, but his fury at her disdainful
attitude forced them from him.</p>

<p>She turned pale and her nostrils quivered. He had
given her a body blow. For a moment they sat side
by side looking at each other like two enraged animals
animated by equally violent if different passions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for saying that,&#8221; she said, when she
could command her voice; &#8220;now I understand what
your love for me means.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from the bench. He seized her hand and
attempted to draw her back, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa, listen to me. You drive me distracted.
You force me to say things like that to you, when you
know that I&#8217;m mad with love for you. Listen&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She tore her hand out of his grasp and ran across the
space to the slope, calling wildly to Benito. The boy
at last could feign deafness no longer and sat up on his
heels in well-simulated surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; she cried angrily. &#8220;Come at once.
I want you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose, dusting his nether parts and shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? why? we&#8217;re havin&#8217; an awful nice time up
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she reiterated; &#8220;it&#8217;s late and we must go.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>He trotted down the slope, extremely reluctant, and
inclined to be rebellious.</p>

<p>Mariposa caught him by the hand and swept him
back toward the path between the spruces. Essex was
still standing near the bench, an elegant figure with
a darkly sinister face. As they passed him he raised
his hat. Mariposa, whose face was bent down, did
not return the salute; so Benito did, as he was hauled
by. She continued to drag the unwilling little boy
along, while he hung loosely from her hand, staring
backward for a last look at his playmate.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; he roared as he was dragged
toward the shadowy path that plunged into the trees.
&#8220;I forget what your name is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was lost in the intervening space, and
the next moment he and Mariposa disappeared behind
the screen of thick-growing evergreens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Benito, &#8220;leggo my hand. What&#8217;s the
sense &#8217;er hauling me this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa did not heed, and they went on at a feverish
pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes your hand shake that way?&#8221; was his
next observation. &#8220;It&#8217;s like grandma&#8217;s when she came
home from Los Angeles with the chills.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in this harmless comment
that caused Mariposa suddenly to loosen her hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand often does that way,&#8221; she said with an air
of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes it?&#8221; asked Benito, suddenly interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; perhaps playing the piano,&#8221; she said,
feeling the necessity of having to dissemble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to be able to make my hand shake that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
way,&#8221; Benito observed enviously. &#8220;When grandma
had the chills I used to watch her. But she shook all
over. Sometimes her teeth used to click. Do your
teeth ever click?&#8221;</p>

<p>The subject interested him and furnished food for
conversation till they reached their car and were swept
homeward over the low hills, breaking here and there
into sand, and with the little oaks crouching in grotesque
fear before the winds.</p>

<p>The third boarder at the Garcias&#8217; was Isaac Pierpont,
the teacher of singing. The Garcia house offered,
at least, the one recommendation of being a place
wherein musically inclined lodgers might make the
welkin ring with the sounds of their industry and no
voice be raised in protest. Between the pounding of
her own pupils Mariposa could hear the voices of Pierpont&#8217;s
as they performed vocal prodigies under their
teacher&#8217;s goadings.</p>

<p>The young man was unusual and interesting. He
had a &#8220;method&#8221; which he expounded to Mariposa during
the process of meals. It was founded on a large
experience of voices in general and a close anatomical
study of the vocal chords. All he wanted, he said, to
demonstrate its excellence to the world was a voice.
Mrs. Garcia, who used to drop in on Mariposa with
her head tied up in white swathings and a broom in
her hand, had early in their acquaintance given her a
life history of the two other boarders, with a running
accompaniment of her own comments. Pierpont had
not her highest approval, as he was exasperatingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
indifferent to money, being bound, to the exclusion of
all lesser interests, on the search for his voice. Half
his pupils were taught for nothing and the other half
forgot to pay, or Pierpont forgot to send in his bills,
which was the same thing in the end, Mrs. Garcia
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s the good of working,&#8221; she said,
daintily brushing the surface of the carpet with her
broom, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t make anything by your work.
What&#8217;s the sense of it, I&#8217;d like to know?&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the singing teacher heard that Mariposa
had a voice he had espied in her the object of his search
and begged her to sing for him. But she had refused.
She had not sung a note since her mother&#8217;s death. The
series of unforeseen and disastrous developments that
had followed the opening scene of the drama in which
she found herself the central figure had robbed her of
all desire to use the gift which was her one source of
fortune. Sometimes, alone in her room, her fingers
running over the keys of the piano, she wondered
dreamily what it would be like once again to hear the
full, vibrating sounds booming out from her chest.
Now and then she had tried a note or two or an old
familiar strain, then had stopped, repelled and disenchanted.
Her voice sounded coarse and strange.
And while it quivered on the air there came a rush of
exquisitely painful memories.</p>

<p>But one afternoon, a few days after her encounter
with Essex, she had come in early to find the lower hall
full of the sound of a high, crystal clear soprano, which
was pouring from the teacher&#8217;s room. She listened interested,
held in a spell of envious attention. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
evidently a girl of whom Pierpont had spoken to her,
who possessed the one voice of promise he had yet
found, and who was studying for the stage. Leaning
over the stair-rail, Mariposa felt, with a tingling at her
heart, that this singing had a finish and poise hers
entirely lacked, and yet the voice was thin, colorless
and fragile compared with her own. With all its
flawless ease and fluency it had not the same splendor
of tone, the same passionate thrill.</p>

<p>She went slowly upstairs, pursued by the beautiful
sounds, bending over the railing to catch them more
fully, with, for the first time since her mother&#8217;s death,
the desire to emulate, to be up and doing, to hear once
more the rich notes swelling from her throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day <i>I&#8217;ll</i> sing for him,&#8221; she said to herself,
with her head up and her eyes bright, &#8220;and he&#8217;ll see
that none of them has a voice like mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stir of enthusiasm was still on her when she
shut the door of her own room. It was hard to settle
to anything with this sudden welling up of old ambitions
disturbing the apathy following on grief. She
was standing, looking down on the garden&mdash;a prospect
which had long lost its forlornness to her accustomed
eyes&mdash;when a knock at the door fell gratefully
on her ears. Even the society of Mrs. Garcia, with
her head tied up in the white duster, had its advantages
now and then.</p>

<p>But it was not Mrs. Garcia, but Mrs. Willers whom
the opening door revealed. Mariposa&#8217;s welcome was
warmed not only by the desire for companionship but
by genuine affection. She had come to regard Mrs.
Willers as her best friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>They did not see each other as often as formerly,
for the newspaper woman found all her time occupied
by her new work. To-day being Monday, she had
managed to get off for the afternoon, as it was in the
Sunday edition that the Woman&#8217;s Page attained its
most imposing proportions. Monday was a day off.
But Mrs. Willers did not always avail herself of it.
She was having the first real chance of her life and was
working harder than she had ever done before. Her
bank account was mounting weekly. On the occasions
when she had time to consult the little book she saw
through the line of figures Edna going to a fine school
in New York, and then, perhaps, a still finer one
abroad, and back of that again&mdash;dimly, as became a
blissful vision&mdash;Edna grown a woman, accomplished,
graceful, beautiful, a glorified figure in a haze of wealth
and success.</p>

<p>She had no war-paint on to-day, but was in her
working clothes, dark and serviceable, showing lapses
between skirt and waist-band, and tag ends of tape
appearing in unexpected places. She had dressed in
such a hurry that morning that only three buttons of
each boot were fastened, though the evening before
Edna had seen to it that they were all on. She had
come up the hill on what she would have called &#8220;a dead
run,&#8221; and was still fetching her breath with gasps.</p>

<p>Sitting opposite Mariposa, in the bright light of the
window, she let her eyes dwell fondly on the girl&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, young woman, do you know I&#8217;ve come up
here on the full jump to lecture you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lecture me?&#8221; said Mariposa, laughing and bending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
forward to give Mrs. Willers&#8217; hand a friendly squeeze.
&#8220;What have I been doing now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ve come to find out. Left a
desk full of work, and Miss Peebles hopping round like
a chicken with its head off, to find out what you&#8217;ve
been doing. I&#8217;d have come up before only I couldn&#8217;t
get away. Mariposa, my dear, I&#8217;ve had a letter from
Mrs. Shackleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa&#8217;s color deepened. A line appeared between
her eyebrows, and she looked out of the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said; &#8220;and did she say anything about
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she did&mdash;a lot. A lot that sorter
stumped me. And I&#8217;ve come up here to-day to find
out what&#8217;s the matter with you. What is it that&#8217;s making
you act like several different kinds of fool all at
once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; said Mariposa weakly, trying
to gain time. &#8220;What did she tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, you know as well as I do what she told
me. And I can&#8217;t make head or tail of it. What&#8217;s
come over you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said the girl in a low voice. &#8220;I
suppose I&#8217;ve changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff!&#8221; observed Mrs. Willers briskly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try
to tell lies; you don&#8217;t know how. One&#8217;s got to have
some natural capacity for it. You&#8217;ve had an offer
that makes it possible for you to go to Europe,
educate your voice, study French and German, and
become a prima donna. Everything&#8217;s to be paid&mdash;no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
limit set on time or money. Now, what in heaven&#8217;s
name made you refuse that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Facing her in the bright light, the questioner&#8217;s eyes
were like gimlets on her face. Mrs. Willers saw its
distressed uneasiness, but could read no further. Three
days before she had received Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s letter,
and had been amazed by its contents. She could
neither assign to herself nor to Mrs. Shackleton a reason
for the girl&#8217;s unexplainable conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain it to you,&#8221; said Mariposa. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&#8217;t
want to go. That was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you wanted to go only a month or two before,
when Shackleton himself made you the offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa nodded without answering.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? That&#8217;s the part that&#8217;s so extraordinary.
You&#8217;d take it from him, but not from his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A person might change her mind, mightn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fool might, but a reasonable woman, without a
cent, with hardly a friend, how could she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa, look me in the eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers met the amber-clear eyes and saw, with
an uneasy thrill, that there was knowledge in them
there had not been before. It was not the limpid
glance of the candid, unspoiled youth it had once been.
She felt a contraction of pain at her heart, as though
she had read the same change in Edna&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made you change your mind?&mdash;that&#8217;s what I
want to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa lowered her lids.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell. What makes anybody change his mind?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
You think differently. Things happen that make you
think differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s happened to make <i>you</i> think differently?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lines appeared again on the smooth forehead.
She shifted her glance to the window and then back
to the hands on her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I don&#8217;t want to tell? I&#8217;m not a little girl
like Edna, to have to tell every thought I have. Mayn&#8217;t
I have a secret, Mrs. Willers?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at her interlocutor with an attempt at a
coaxing smile. Mrs. Willers saw that it was an effort,
and remained grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to have secrets from me, dear, no
more than I would Edna. Mariposa,&#8221; she said in a
lowered voice, leaning forward and putting her hand
on the girl&#8217;s knee, &#8220;is it because of some man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa looked up quickly. The elder woman saw
that, for a moment, she was startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some man!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;What man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed your mind because of Essex?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Essex!&#8221; She slowly crimsoned, and Mrs. Willers
kept her pitiless eyes on the rising flood of color.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear girl,&#8221; she said almost in an agony,
&#8220;don&#8217;t say you&#8217;ve got fond of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like Mr. Essex. I&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t bear him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers knew enough of human nature not to
be at all convinced by this remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not the man for any woman to give her heart
to. He&#8217;s not the man to take seriously. He&#8217;s never
loved anything in his life but himself. Don&#8217;t let yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
be fooled by him. He&#8217;s handsome, and he&#8217;s about
the smoothest talker I ever ran up against. But don&#8217;t
you be crazy enough to fall in love with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, I don&#8217;t like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness, I wish there was somebody in this
world to take care of you. You&#8217;ve got no sense, and
you&#8217;re so unfortunately good-looking. Some day
you&#8217;ll be fooled just as I was with Willers. Are you
telling the truth? It isn&#8217;t Essex that&#8217;s made you
change your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>These repeated accusations exasperated Mariposa.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is not,&#8221; she said angrily; and then, in the
heat of her annoyance, &#8220;if anything would make me
accept Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s offer it would be the hope
of getting away from that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no doubt she was speaking the truth now.
Mrs. Willers&#8217; point of view of the situation underwent
a kaleidoscopic upsetting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, in a subdued voice, &#8220;then it&#8217;s <i>he</i>
that&#8217;s in love?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl made no answer. She felt hot and sore,
pricked by this insistent probing of spots that were
still raw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he&mdash;does he&mdash;bother you?&#8221; the elder woman
said in an incredulous voice. Somehow she could not
reconcile the picture of Essex as a repulsed and suppliant
wooer with her knowledge of him as such a very
self-assured and debonair person.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by &#8216;bother me,&#8217;&#8221; said
Mariposa, still heated. &#8220;He makes love to me, and I
don&#8217;t like it. I don&#8217;t like him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;Makes love to you? What do you mean by &#8216;makes
love to you?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has asked me to be his wife,&#8221; said the victim,
goaded to desperation by this tormenting catechism.</p>

<p>She could not have confessed that Essex had entertained
other designs with regard to her, any more
than she could have told her real reason for refusing
Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s offer. But she felt ashamed and
miserable at these half-truths, which her friend was
giving ear to with the wide eyes of wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, &#8220;I never thought that
man would want to marry a poor girl. But that&#8217;s not
as surprising as that you had sense enough to refuse
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him. I know I&#8217;m stupid, but I know
when I like a person and when I don&#8217;t. And I&#8217;d rather
stand on the corner of Kearney and Sutter Streets with
a tin cup begging for nickels than marry Mr. Essex,
or be sent to Europe by Mrs. Shackleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a combination of smartness and folly
I never expect to see beaten. You&#8217;ve got sense enough
to refuse to marry a man who&#8217;s bound to make you
miserable. That&#8217;s astonishing in any girl. And then,
on the other hand, you throw up the chance of a lifetime
for nothing. That would be astonishing in a
candidate for entrance into an asylum for the feeble-minded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am feeble-minded,&#8221; said Mariposa humbly.
&#8220;I certainly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m very clever, especially
now with everybody telling me what a fool I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re only a fool on that one point, honey. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
that&#8217;s what makes it so aggravating. It&#8217;s just a kink
in your brain, for you&#8217;ve got no reason to act the way
you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke positively, but her pleading look at Mariposa
showed that she was not yet willing to give up the
search for a reason. Mariposa leaned forward and
took her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear Mrs. Willers,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don&#8217;t ask me any
more. Don&#8217;t tease me. I do love you, and you&#8217;ve
been so kind to me I can never stop loving you, no matter
what you did. But let me be. Perhaps I have a
reason, and perhaps I am only a fool, but whichever
way it is, be sure I haven&#8217;t acted hastily; and I&#8217;ve suffered,
too, trying to do what seemed to me right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes suddenly filled with tears, and she got up
quickly to hide them, and stood looking out of the
window. Mrs. Willers rose, too, and, putting an arm
around her, kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try not to bother. But
you want to tell me whatever you think you can.
You&#8217;re too good-looking, Mariposa, and you&#8217;re such&mdash;a&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fool,&#8221; came from Mariposa, in the stifled tones
of imminent tears. There was a moment&#8217;s pause, and
then their simultaneous laughter filled the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see you can&#8217;t help saying it,&#8221; said Mariposa,
laughing foolishly, with the tears hanging on her
lashes. &#8220;It&#8217;s like any other bad habit&mdash;its getting entire
control of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later Mrs. Willers was walking
quickly down the hill toward Sutter Street, her brows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
knit in thought. She had certainly discovered nothing.
In her pocket was Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s letter telling
of Miss Moreau&#8217;s refusal of her offer and asking if
Mrs. Willers knew the reason of it. Mrs. Shackleton
had wondered if Miss Moreau&#8217;s affections had been
engaged, which could perhaps account for her otherwise
unaccountable rejection of an opportunity upon
which her whole future might depend.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers had been relieved to find there was
certainly no man influencing Miss Moreau&#8217;s decision.
For unless it was Essex, it could be no one. Mrs.
Willers knew the paucity of Mariposa&#8217;s social circle.
That Essex had asked the girl to marry him and been
refused was astonishing. The rejection was only a
little more surprising than the offer. For a man like
Essex to want to marry a penniless orphan was only
exceeded in singularity by a girl like Mariposa refusing
a man of Essex&#8217;s indisputable attractions. But
there was always something to be thankful for in the
darkest situation, and Mariposa undoubtedly had no
intention of marrying him. Providence was guiding
her, at least, in that respect.</p>

<p>It was still early when Mrs. Willers approached <i>The
Trumpet</i> office. The sky was leaden and hung with
low clouds. As she drew near the door the first few
drops of rain fell, spotting the sidewalk here and there
as though they were slowly and reluctantly wrung from
the swollen heavens. It would be a storm, she thought,
as she turned into the doorway and began the ascent
of the dark stairs with the lanterns on the landings.
In her own cubby-hole she answered Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
letter, and then passed along the passageway to the
sanctum of the proprietor, who was still in his office.</p>

<p>Win, in his father&#8217;s swivel chair, looked very small
and insignificant. The wide window behind him let
a flood of pale light over his bullet-shaped head with
its thatch of limp, blond hair, and his thin shoulders
bowed over the desk. His eyes narrowed behind his
glasses as he looked up in answer to Mrs. Willers&#8217;
knock, and then, when he saw who it was, he smiled,
for Win liked Mrs. Willers.</p>

<p>She handed him the letter with the request that he
give it to his mother that evening, and sat down in
the chair beside him, facing the long white panes of
the window, which the rain was beginning to lash.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother and you seem to be having a lively correspondence,&#8221;
said Win, who had brought down Mrs.
Shackleton&#8217;s letter some days before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve got an untractable young lady on our
hands, and it&#8217;s a large order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Moreau?&#8221; said the proprietor of <i>The Trumpet</i>.
&#8220;My mother told me. She&#8217;s very independent, isn&#8217;t
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a strange girl. You can tell your mother,
as I&#8217;ve told her in this letter, that I don&#8217;t understand
her at all. She&#8217;s got some idea in her head, but I
can&#8217;t make it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mightn&#8217;t a girl just be independent?&#8221; said the
young man, putting up a long, thin hand to press his
glasses against his nose with a first and second finger.
&#8220;Just independent, and nothing else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no knowing what a girl mightn&#8217;t be, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
Shackleton,&#8221; Mrs. Willers responded gloomily. &#8220;I was
one myself once, but it&#8217;s so long ago I&#8217;ve forgotten what
it&#8217;s like; and, thank heaven, it&#8217;s a stage that&#8217;s soon
passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>It so happened that this little conversation set Win&#8217;s
mind once more to thinking of the girl his father had
been so determined to find and benefit. As he left
<i>The Trumpet</i> office, shortly after the withdrawal of
Mrs. Willers, his mind was full of the queries the finding
of the letters had aroused in it. The handsome
girl he had seen that afternoon, three months ago,
appeared before his mental vision, and this time as
her face flashed out on him from the dark places of
memory it had a sudden tantalizing suggestion of
familiarity. The question came that so often teases us
with the sudden glimpse of a vaguely recognized face:
&#8220;Where have I seen it before?&#8221;</p>

<p>Win walked slowly up Third Street meditating
under a spread umbrella. It was raining hard now, a
level downpour that beat pugnaciously on the city,
which gleamed and ran rillets of water under the
onslaught. People were scurrying away in every
direction, women with umbrellas low against their
heads, one hand gripping up their skirts, from beneath
which came and went glimpses of muddy boots
and wet petticoats. Loafers were standing under
eaves, looking out with yellow, apathetic faces. The
merchants of the quarter came to the doorways of the
smaller shops that Win passed, and stood looking out
and then up into the sky with musing smiles. It was
a heavy rain, and no mistake.</p>

<p>Win had a commission to execute before he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
home, and so passed up Kearney Street to Post, where,
a few doors from the corner, he entered a photographer&#8217;s.
He was having a copy made on ivory of
an old daguerreotype of his father, to be given as a
present to his mother, and to-day it was to be finished.</p>

<p>The photographer, a clever and capable man, had
started the innovation of having his studio roughly
lined with burlaps, upon which photographs of local
belles and celebrities were fastened with brass-headed
nails. Win, waiting for his appearance, loitered round
the room looking at these, recognizing a friend here,
and there a proud beauty who had endured him as a
partner at the cotillion because he was the only son of
Jake Shackleton. Farther on was one of Edna Willers,
looking very lovely and seraphic in her large-eyed
innocence.</p>

<p>On a small slip of wall between two windows there
was only one picture fastened, and as his eye fell on
this he started. It was Mariposa Moreau, in the lace
dress she had worn at the opera, the face looking directly
and gravely into his. At the moment that his
glance, fresh from other faces, fell on it, the haunting
suggestion of familiarity, of having some intimate connection
with or memory of it, possessed him with sudden,
startling force. Of whom did she remind him?</p>

<p>He backed away from it, and, as he did so, was conscious
that he knew exactly the way her lips would open
if she had been going to speak, of the precise manner
she had of lifting her chin. Yet he had seen her only
twice in his life that he knew of, and then in the half-dark.
It was not she that was known to him, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
some one that she looked like&mdash;some one he knew well,
that had some vague, yet close connection with his
life. He felt in an eery way that his mind was gropingly
approaching the solution, had almost seized it,
when the photographer&#8217;s voice behind him broke the
thread.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be ready in a moment, Mr. Shackleton,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking at that picture. It&#8217;s a Miss
Moreau, a young lady who, I believe, is a singer. I
put it there by itself, as I was just a little proud of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a stunning picture and no mistake,&#8221; said Win,
arranging his glasses, &#8220;but it must be easy to make a
picture of a girl like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I think it&#8217;s hard. Miss Moreau&#8217;s
handsome, but it&#8217;s a beauty that&#8217;s more suitable to a
painter than a photographer. It&#8217;s the coloring that&#8217;s
so remarkable, so rich and yet so refined&mdash;that white
skin and dark red hair. That&#8217;s why I am proud of the
picture. It suggests the coloring, I think. It seems
to me there&#8217;s something warm about that hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Win said vaguely, yes, he guessed there must
be, wondering what the fellow meant about there
being something warm about the hair. Further comment
was ended by an attendant coming forward with
the picture and handing it to the photographer.</p>

<p>The man held it out to Win with a proud smile. It
was an enlargement of a small daguerreotype, taken
some twenty years previously, and representing
Shackleton in full face and without his beard. The
work had been excellently done. It was a faithful and
spirited likeness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>As his eye fell on it Win suffered a sudden and
amazing revelation. It was like a dazzling flash of
light tearing away the shadows of a dark place.
Through the obscurity of his mind enlightenment rent
like a current of electricity. That was what the memory
was, that dim sense of previous knowledge, that
groping after something well known and yet elusive.</p>

<p>He stared at the picture, and then turned and looked
at Mariposa&#8217;s hanging on the wall. The photographer,
looking commiseratingly at him, evidently
mistaking his obvious perturbation of mind for a rush
of filial affection, recalled him to himself. He did not
know that he was pale, but he saw that the plate of
ivory in his hand trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;first-rate,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m
tremendously pleased. Send it to <i>The Trumpet</i> office
to-morrow, and the bill with it, please. You&#8217;ve done
an A number one job.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away and went slowly out, the photographer
and his assistant looking curiously after him.
There were steps to go down before he regained the
street, and he descended them in a maze, the rain
pouring on his head, his closed umbrella in his hand.
It was all as clear as daylight now&mdash;the secret searching
out of the mother and daughter, the interest taken
by his father in the beautiful and talented girl, his desire
to educate and provide for her. It was all as plain
as A, B, C.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was so different from Maud and me,&#8221; Win
thought humbly, as he moved forward in the blinding
rain. &#8220;No wonder he was fond of her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>It was so astonishing, so simple, and yet so hard
to realize in the first moment of discovery this way,
that he stopped and stood staring at the pavement.</p>

<p>Two of his friends, umbrellaed and mackintoshed,
bore down on him, not recognizing the motionless
figure with the water running off its hat brim till they
were close on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Win, gone crazy!&#8221; cried one gaily. &#8220;When did it
come on, Winnie boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up startled, and had presence of mind
enough not to open his umbrella.</p>

<p>&#8220;Win&#8217;s trying to grow,&#8221; said the other, knowing that
his insignificant size was a mortification to the young
man. &#8220;So he&#8217;s standing out in the rain like a plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rain&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Win. &#8220;I like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt about that, sonny. Only thing to doubt&#8217;s
your sanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cute little day, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; said his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Win likes it,&#8221; said the first. &#8220;Keep it up, old chap,
and you&#8217;ll be six feet high before the winter&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they went off cackling to the club to tell the
story of Win, with the water pouring off his hat and his
glasses damp, standing staring at the pavement on
Post Street.</p>

<p>Win opened his umbrella and went on. He walked
home slowly and by a circuitous route. His mind traversed
the subject back and forth, and at each moment
he became more convinced, as all the muddle of puzzling
circumstances fell into place in logical sequence.</p>

<p>She was his half-sister, older than he was&mdash;his
father&#8217;s first-born. By this accident of birth she was
an outcast, penniless and unacknowledged, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
home and fortune he and Maud had inherited. At the
very moment when the father had found her free to
accept his bounty he had been snatched away. And
she knew it. That was the explanation of her changeable
conduct. She had found it out in some way between
the deaths of her mother and Shackleton. Some
one had told her or she had discovered it herself.</p>

<p>In the dripping dark Win pondered it all, going up
and down the ascending streets in a tortuous route
homeward, wondering at fate, communing with himself.</p>

<p>Win found his mother in her boudoir and delivered
Mrs. Willers&#8217; letter to her without comment. He saw
her read it and then sit silent, her brows drawn, looking
into the fire beside which she sat. It was impossible
just then for him to allude to the subject of the
letter, and, after standing by the mantelpiece awkwardly
warming his wet feet, he went upstairs to his
own rooms.</p>

<p>At dinner the family trio was unusually quiet.
Under the blaze of light that fell from the great crystal
chandelier over the table with its weight of glass and
silver, the three participants looked preoccupied and
stupid. The two Chinese servants, soft-footed as cats,
and spotless in their crisp white, moved about the table
noiselessly, offering dish after dish to their impassive
employers.</p>

<p>It was one of those irritating occasions when everything
seems to combine for the purpose of exasperating.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
Bessie, annoyed by the contents of Mrs. Willers&#8217;
letter, found her annoyance augmented by the fact that
Maud looked particularly plain that evening, and the
Count de Lamolle was expected after dinner. Worry
had robbed her face of such sparkle as it possessed and
had accentuated its ungirlish heaviness. She felt that
her engagement to Latimer must be announced, for the
Count de Lamolle was exhibiting those signs of a coming
proposal that she knew well, and what excuse could
she give her mother for rejecting him? She must tell
the truth, and the thought alarmed her shrinking and
peaceable soul. She sat silent, crumbling her bread
with a nervous hand and wondering how she could
possibly avert the offer if the count showed symptoms
of making it that evening.</p>

<p>After dinner her mother left her in the small reception-room,
a rich and ornate apartment, furnished in
an oriental manner with divans, cushions, and Moorish
hangings. The zeal for chaperonage had not yet
penetrated to the West, and Bessie considered that to
leave her daughter thus alone was to discharge her duties
as a parent with delicate correctness. She retired
to the adjoining library, where the count, on entering,
had a glimpse of her sitting in a low chair, languidly
turning the pages of a magazine. He, on his part, had
lived in the West long enough to know that the disposal
of the family in these segregated units was what
custom and conventionality dictated.</p>

<p>The count was a clever man and had studied the
United States from other points of vantage than the
window of a Pullman car.</p>

<p>With the murmur of his greetings to Maud in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
ears, Bessie rose from her chair. She found the library
chill and cheerless after her cozy boudoir on the floor
above, and decided to go there. Glancing over her
shoulder, as she mounted the stairs, she could see the
count standing with his back to the fire, discoursing
with a smile&mdash;a handsome, personable man, with his
dark face and pointed beard looking darker than ever
over his gleaming expanse of shirt bosom. It would
be an entirely desirable marriage for Maud. Bessie
had found out all about the count&#8217;s position and title in
his native land, and both were all that he said they were,
which had satisfied and surprised her.</p>

<p>In her own room she sat down before the fire to
think. Maud&#8217;s future was in her own hands now,
molding itself into shape downstairs in the reception-room.
Bessie could do no more toward directing it
than she had already done, and her active mind immediately
seized on the other subject that had been engrossing
it. She drew out Mrs. Willers&#8217; letter and
read it again. Then crumpling it in her hand, she
looked into the fire with eyes of somber perplexity.</p>

<p>What was the matter with the girl? Mrs. Willers
stated positively that, as far as she could ascertain,
there was no man that had the slightest influence over
Mariposa Moreau&#8217;s affections. She was acting entirely
on her own volition. But what had made her change
her mind, Mrs. Willers did not know. Something
had undoubtedly occurred, she thought, that had influenced
Mariposa to a total reversal of opinion. Mrs.
Willers said she could not imagine what this was, but
it had changed the girl, not only in ambition and point
of view, but in character.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>The letter frightened Bessie. It had made her silent
all through dinner, and now brooding over the fire, she
thought of what it might mean and felt a cold apprehension
seize her. Could Mariposa know? Her behavior
and conduct since Shackleton&#8217;s death suggested
such a possibility. It was incredible to think of, but
Lucy might have told. And also, might not the girl,
in arranging her mother&#8217;s effects after her death, have
come on something, letters or papers, which had revealed
the past?</p>

<p>A memory rose up in Bessie&#8217;s mind of the girl wife
she had supplanted, clinging to the marriage certificate,
which was all that remained to remind her of the days
when she had been the one lawful wife. Bessie knew
that this paper had been carefully tied in the bundle
which held Lucy&#8217;s few possessions when they left Salt
Lake. She knew it was still in the bundle when she,
herself, had handed it to the deserted girl in front of
Moreau&#8217;s cabin. Might not Mariposa have found it?</p>

<p>She rose and walked about the room, feeling sick at
the thought. She was no longer young, and her iron
nerve had been permanently shaken by the suddenness
of her husband&#8217;s death. Mariposa, with her mother&#8217;s
marriage certificate, might be plotting some desperate
<i>coup</i>. No wonder she refused to go to Paris! If she
could establish her claim as Shackleton&#8217;s eldest and
only legitimate child, she would not only sweep from
Win and Maud the lion&#8217;s share of their inheritance, but,
equally unbearable, she would drag to the light the
ugly story&mdash;the terrible story that Jake Shackleton and
his second wife had so successfully hidden.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were suddenly broken in on by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
bang of the front door. She looked at the clock and
saw it was only nine. If it was the count who was
going he had stayed less than an hour. What had happened?
She moved to the door and listened.</p>

<p>She heard a light step, slowly and furtively mounting
the stairs. It was Maud, for, though she could attempt
to deaden her footfall, she could not hush the rustling
of her silken skirts. As the sweeping sound reached
the stair-head, Bessie opened her door. Maud stopped
short, her black dress fading into the darkness about
her, so that her white face seemed to be floating unattached
through the air like an optical delusion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mommer,&#8221; she said, falteringly, &#8220;I thought
you were in bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the count gone?&#8221; queried her mother, with an
unusual sternness of tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;he&#8217;s gone. He&mdash;he&mdash;went
early to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did he go so early?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t want to stay any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud was terrified. Her hand clutching the balustrade
was trembling and icy. In her father&#8217;s lifetime
she had known that she would never dare to tell of her
engagement to Latimer. She would have ended by
eloping. Now, the fear of her mother, who had always
been the gentler parent, froze her timid soul, and even
the joy of her love seemed swamped in this dreadful
moment of confession.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the count ask you to marry him?&#8221; said Bessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! and&mdash;&#8221; with tremulous desperation, &#8220;I said
no, I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;You said no! that&#8217;s not possible. You couldn&#8217;t be
such a fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was, and I said it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in here, Maud,&#8221; said her mother, standing
back from the doorway; &#8220;we can&#8217;t talk sensibly this
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Maud did not move.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to go in there,&#8221; she said, like a
naughty child; &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing to talk about. I don&#8217;t
want to marry him and I told him so and he&#8217;s gone,
and that&#8217;s the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The end of it! That&#8217;s nonsense. I want you to
marry Count de Lamolle. I don&#8217;t want to hear silly
talk like this. I&#8217;ll write to him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it won&#8217;t do you or him any good,&#8221; said
Maud, to whom fear was giving courage, &#8220;for I won&#8217;t
marry him, and neither you nor he can drag me to the
altar if I won&#8217;t go. It&#8217;s not the time of the Crusades.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Maud&#8217;s allusion was not precisely illuminating,
her mother understood it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not be the time of the Crusades,&#8221; she said,
grimly, &#8220;but neither is it a time when girls can be fools
and no one hold out a hand to check them. Do you
realize what this marriage means for you? Position,
title, an entrance into society that you never in any
other way could put as much as the end of your nose
into.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t want to put even the end of my nose into
it, what good does it do me? You know I hate society.
I hate going to dinners and sitting beside people who
talk to me about things I don&#8217;t understand or care for.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
I hate going to balls and dancing round and round like
a teetotum with men I don&#8217;t like. And if it&#8217;s bad here,
what would it be over there where I don&#8217;t speak their
language or know their ways, and they&#8217;d think I was
just something queer and savage the count had caught
over here with a lasso.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fears and doubts she had never spoken of to any
one but Latimer came glibly to her lips in this moment
of misery. Her mother was surprised at her
fluency.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re piling up objections out of nothing,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;When those people over in France know what
your fortune is, make no mistake, they&#8217;ll be only too
glad to know you and be your friend. They&#8217;ll not
think you queer and savage. You&#8217;ll be on the top of
everything over there, not just one of a bunch of
bonanza heiresses, as you are here. And the count?
Do you know any one so handsome, so gentlemanly,
so elegant and polite in San Francisco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a man I like better,&#8221; said Maud, in a muffled
voice.</p>

<p>The white face, with its dimly suggested figure,
looked whiter than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; said her mother,
stiffening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean Jack Latimer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Latimer? One of your father&#8217;s clerks! Maud,
come in here at once. I can&#8217;t stand talking in the hall
of things like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t come in,&#8221; cried Maud, backing away
against the baluster, and feeling as she used to do in
her juvenile days, when she was hauled by the hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
to the scene of punishment. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more
to talk about. I&#8217;m engaged to Jack Latimer, and I&#8217;m
going to marry him, and that&#8217;s the beginning and the
end of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt desperately defiant, standing there in the
darkness looking at her mother&#8217;s massive shape
against the glow of the lit doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack Latimer!&#8221; reiterated Mrs. Shackleton, &#8220;who
only gets a hundred and fifty dollars a month and has
to give some of it to his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, haven&#8217;t I got enough for two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maud, you&#8217;ve gone crazy. All I know is that I&#8217;ll
not let you spoil your future. I&#8217;ll write to Count de
Lamolle to-morrow, and I&#8217;ll write to Jack Latimer,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good will that do anybody? Count de Lamolle
can&#8217;t marry me if I don&#8217;t want to. And why
should Jack Latimer throw me over because you ask
him to? He,&#8221; she made a tremulous hesitation that
would have touched a softer heart, and then added,
&#8220;he likes me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likes you!&#8221; repeated her mother, with furious
scorn, &#8220;he likes the five million dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me,&#8221; said Maud, passionately; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t the
money. And he&#8217;s the only person in the world except
Win who has ever really liked me. I don&#8217;t feel when
I&#8217;m with him that I&#8217;m so ugly and stupid, the way I
feel with everybody else. He likes to hear me talk,
and when he looks at me I don&#8217;t feel as if he was saying
to himself, &#8216;What an ugly girl she is, anyway.&#8217;
But I feel that he doesn&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m pretty or
ugly. He only knows he loves me the way I am.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>She burst into wild tears, and before her mother
could answer or arrest her, had brushed past her and
fled up the next flight of stairs, the sound of her
sobs floating down from the upper darkness to the
listener&#8217;s ears. Bessie retreated into the boudoir and
shut the door.</p>

<p>Maud ran on and burst into her own room, there
to throw herself on the bed and weep despairingly for
hours. She thought of her lover, the one human being
besides her brother who had never made her feel her
inferiority, and lying limp and shaken among the pillows,
thought, with a wild thrill of longing of the
time when she would be free to creep into his arms
and hide the ugly face he found so satisfactory upon
his heart.</p>

<p>In the morning, before she was up, Bessie visited
her and renewed the conversation of the night before.
Poor Maud, with a throbbing head and heavy eyes, lay
helpless, answering questions that probed the tender
secrets of the clandestine courtship, which had been
to her an oasis of almost terrifying happiness in the
lonely repression of her life. Finally, unable longer
to endure her mother&#8217;s sarcastic allusions to Latimer&#8217;s
disingenuousness, she sprang out of bed and ran into
the bath-room, which was part of the suite she occupied.
Here she turned on both taps, the sound of the
rushing water completely drowning her mother&#8217;s
voice, and sitting on the side of the tub, looked drearily
down into the bath, while Bessie&#8217;s concluding and
indignant sentences rose from the outer side of the
door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shackleton lunched alone that day. Win generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
went to his club for his midday meal, and Maud
had gone out early and found hospitality at the house
of Pussy Thurston. Bessie had done more thinking
that morning in the intervals of her domestic duties&mdash;she
was a notable housekeeper and personally superintended
every department of her establishment&mdash;and
had decided to dedicate part of the afternoon to
the society of Mrs. Willers. One of the secrets of
Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s success in life had been her power
to control and retain interests in divers matters at the
same time. Maud&#8217;s unpleasant news had not pushed
the even more weighty subject of Mariposa into abeyance.
It was as prominent as ever in the widow&#8217;s
mind.</p>

<p>She drove down to <i>The Trumpet</i> office soon after
lunch and slowly mounted the long stairs. It would
have been a hardship for any other woman of her
years and weight, but Bessie&#8217;s bodily energy was still
remarkable, and she had never indulged herself in the
luxury of laziness. At the top of the fourth flight she
paused, panting, while the astonished office boy stared
at her, recognizing her as the chief&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers was in her cubby-hole, with a drop-light
sending a little circle of yellow radiance over the
middle of the desk. A litter of newspaper cuttings
surrounded her, and Miss Peebles, at the moment of
Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s entrance, was in the cane-bottomed
chair, in which aspirants for journalistic honors usually
sat. The rustle of Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s silks and the
faint advancing perfume that preceded her, announced
an arrival of unusual distinction, and Miss Peebles
had turned uneasily in the chair and Mrs. Willers was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
peering out from the circle of the drop-light, when the
lady entered the room.</p>

<p>Miss Peebles rose with a flurried haste and thrust
forward the chair, and Mrs. Willers extricated herself
from the heaped up newspapers and extended a welcoming
hand. The greetings ended, the younger
woman bowed herself out, her opinion of Mrs. Willers,
if possible, higher even than it had been before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers was surprised, but discreetly refrained
from showing it. She had known Mrs. Shackleton
for several years, and had once heard, from her late
chief, that his wife approved her matter and counseled
her advancement.</p>

<p>But to have her appear thus unannounced in the
intimate heat and burden of office hours was decidedly
unexpected. Mrs. Shackleton knew this and proceeded
to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must think it queer, my coming down on you
this way, when you&#8217;re up to your neck in work, but I
won&#8217;t keep you ten minutes.&#8221; She looked at the small
nickel clock that ticked aggressively in the middle of
the desk. &#8220;And I know you are too busy a woman to
ask you to come all the way up to my house. So I&#8217;ve
come down to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pleased and flattered,&#8221; murmured Mrs. Willers,
pushing back her chair, and kicking a space in the
newspapers, so that she could cross her knees at ease.
&#8220;But, don&#8217;t hurry, Mrs. Shackleton. Work&#8217;s well on
and I&#8217;m at your disposal for a good many ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just to talk over that letter you sent me by Win.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
What do you understand by Miss Moreau&#8217;s behavior,
Mrs. Willers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand anything by it. I don&#8217;t understand
it at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it seems to me. There&#8217;s only one
explanation of it that I can see, and you say that
isn&#8217;t the right one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That there&#8217;s some man here she&#8217;s interested in.
When a girl of that age, without a cent, or a friend or
a prospect, refuses an offer that means a successful and
maybe a famous future, what&#8217;s a person to think?
Something&#8217;s stopping her. And the only thing I know
of that would stop her is that she&#8217;s fallen in love. But
you say she hasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t strike me as being so. She don&#8217;t talk
like a girl in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any man who is interested in her and sees
her continually?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers was naturally a truthful woman, but
a hard experience of life had taught her to prevaricate
with skill and coolness when she thought the occasion
demanded it. She saw no menace now, however, and
was entirely in sympathy with Mrs. Shackleton in
her annoyance at Mariposa&#8217;s irritating behavior.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, nodding with grave eyes, &#8220;there <i>is</i>
a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there <i>is</i>,&#8221; said the other, bending forward with
a sudden eager interest that was not lost upon Mrs.
Willers. &#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of our men here, Barry Essex.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>&#8220;Essex!&#8221; exclaimed the widow, with a sudden light
of relieved comprehension suffusing her glance. &#8220;Of
course. I know him. That dark, foreign-looking man
that nobody knows anything about. Mr. Shackleton
thought a great deal of him; said he was thrown away
on <i>The Trumpet</i>. He&#8217;s not a bit an ordinary sort of
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, nodding her
head in somber acquiescence. &#8220;And you&#8217;re right about
nobody knowing anything about him. He&#8217;s a dark
mystery, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you say he&#8217;s in love with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d infer from what she tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>does</i> she tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s asked her to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they&#8217;re engaged. That accounts for the
whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re not engaged. She&#8217;s refused him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Refused him? That girl who&#8217;s been living in an
adobe at Santa Barbara, refuse that fine-looking fellow?
Why, she&#8217;ll never see a man like that again in
her life. <i>She&#8217;s</i> not refused him? Of course, she&#8217;s engaged
to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re mistaken. She&#8217;s not. She doesn&#8217;t like
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she tells you. Girls always say that
sort of thing. That explains the way she&#8217;s acted
from the start. He hadn&#8217;t asked her when Mr. Shackleton
was alive. She&#8217;s engaged to him now and
doesn&#8217;t want to leave him. She struck me as just
that soft, sentimental sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, Mrs. Shackleton; I know Mariposa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
Moreau. She tells the truth; all of it. That&#8217;s why
it&#8217;s so hard sometimes to understand what she means.
We&#8217;re not used to it. She doesn&#8217;t like that man, and
she wouldn&#8217;t marry him if he was hung all over with
diamonds and was going to give her the Con Virginia
for a wedding present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; ejaculated her companion, with sudden,
sharp irritation. &#8220;That&#8217;s what she says. They have
no money to marry on, I suppose, and she&#8217;s trying to
keep her engagement secret. It explains everything.
I must say I&#8217;m relieved. I had the girl on my mind,
and it seemed to me she was so senseless and fly-away
that you didn&#8217;t know where she&#8217;d fetch up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers was annoyed. It was not pleasant to
her to hear Mariposa spoken of this way. But a long
life of struggle and misfortune had taught her, among
other valuable things, the art of hiding unprofitable
anger under a bland smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all I can say,&#8221; she said, laughing quite naturally,
&#8220;is that I hope you&#8217;re wrong. I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t
want to see her married to that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; queried Mrs. Shackleton, with the
sudden arrested glance of surprised curiosity. &#8220;What
is there to object to in such a marriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hundreds of things,&#8221; answered Mrs. Willers, feeling
that there are many disadvantages in having to
converse with your employer&#8217;s mother on the subject
of one of your best friends. &#8220;Who knows anything
about Barry Essex? No one knows where he comes
from, or who he is, or even if Essex is his name. I
don&#8217;t believe it is, at all. I think he just took it because
it sounds like the aristocracy. And what&#8217;s his record?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
I&#8217;ll lay ten to one there are things behind him he
wouldn&#8217;t like to see published on the front page of <i>The
Trumpet</i>. He&#8217;s no man to make a girl happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to be taking a good deal for granted.
Because you don&#8217;t know anything about him, it&#8217;s no
reason to suppose the worst. He certainly looks and
acts like a gentleman, and he&#8217;s finely educated. And
isn&#8217;t it better for a girl like Miss Moreau to have a
husband to take care of her than to go roaming around
by herself, throwing away every chance she gets, for
some crazy notion? That young woman&#8217;s not able to
take care of herself. The best thing for her is to get
Barry Essex to do it for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known women,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, judicially,
&#8220;who thought that a bad husband was better than no
husband at all. But I&#8217;m not of that opinion myself,
having had one of the bad ones. Solomon said a corner
of a housetop and a dinner of herbs was better
than a wide house with a brawling woman. And I
tell you that one room in Tar Flat and beef&#8217;s liver for
every meal is better than a palace on Nob Hill with a
husband that&#8217;s no account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re inclined to look on the dark side
of matrimony,&#8221; said Mrs. Shackleton, laughing, as
she rose from her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;May be so,&#8221; said the other; &#8220;but after my experience
I don&#8217;t think it such a blissful state that I want
to round up all my friends and drive them into the
corral, whether they want to go or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Shackleton looked down for a pondering moment.
She was evidently not listening. Raising her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
head she met Mrs. Willers&#8217; half-sad, half-twinkling
eyes with a gaze of keen scrutiny, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if it isn&#8217;t a love affair, what is it that&#8217;s made
Miss Moreau change her mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Mrs. Willers shrugged her shoulders.
&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know as well as you. I can
only say what it&#8217;s not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s Barry Essex. Well, Mrs. Willers,
you&#8217;re a smart woman, but you know your business
better than you do the vagaries of young girls. I don&#8217;t
know Miss Moreau well, but I&#8217;d like to bet that I understand
her this time better than you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled genially and held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My ten minutes are up,&#8221; nodding at the clock.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m too much of a business woman to outstay
my time limit. No&#8221;&mdash;in answer to Mrs. Willers&#8217; polite
demur&mdash;&#8220;I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved toward the door, then paused and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Essex a sort of Frenchman? Or wasn&#8217;t he,
anyway, brought up in Paris, or had a French mother,
or something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to his mother,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, sourly, &#8220;the
Lord alone knows who she was. I&#8217;ve heard she was
everything from the daughter of a duke to a snake-charmer
in a dime museum. But he told me he was
born and partly educated in Paris, and Madame Bertrand,
at the R&ocirc;tisserie, tells me he must have been, as
he talks real French French, not the kind you learn out
of a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly looks like a Frenchman,&#8221; said the departing
guest. &#8220;Well, good by. It&#8217;s a sort of bond between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
us to try to settle to her advantage this silly
girl who doesn&#8217;t want to be settled. If you hear any
more of her affair with Essex, you might let me know.
In spite of my criticisms, I take the greatest interest in
her. I wouldn&#8217;t criticize if I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mrs. Shackleton was slowly descending the long
stairs, Mrs. Willers still stood beside her desk, thinking.
The visit had surprised her in the beginning.
Now it left her feeling puzzled and vaguely disturbed.
Why did Mrs. Shackleton seem to be so desirous of
thinking that Mariposa was betrothed to Essex? The
bonanza king&#8217;s widow was a woman of large charities
and carelessly magnificent generosities, but she was
also a woman of keen insight and unwavering common
sense. Her interest in Mariposa was as strong
as her husband&#8217;s, and was entirely explainable as his
had been, in the light of their old acquaintance with
the girl&#8217;s father. What Mrs. Willers could not understand
was how any person, who had Mariposa
Moreau&#8217;s welfare at heart, could derive satisfaction
from the thought of her marrying Barry Essex.</p>

<small>FRIEND AND BROTHER</small></h3>
</div>



<p class="quote">&#8220;Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and by it there is
profit to them that see the sun.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ecclesiastes.</span></p>



<p>Mariposa&#8217;s sixteen dollars a month had been augmented
to twenty-eight by the accession of three new
pupils. These had been acquired through Isaac Pierpont,
who was glad to find a cheap teacher for his
potential prima donnas, who were frequently lacking
in the simplest knowledge of instrumental music.</p>

<p>Mariposa was impressed and flattered by her extended
clientele, and at first felt some embarrassment
in finding that one of the pupils was a woman ten years
older than herself. The worry she had felt on the
score of her living was now at rest, for Pierpont had
promised her his continued aid, and her new scholars
professed themselves much pleased with her efforts.</p>

<p>Her monthly earnings were sufficient to cover her
exceedingly modest living expenses. The remnants of
her fortune&mdash;the few dollars left after her mother&#8217;s
funeral and the money realized by the sale of the
jewelry and furniture that were the last relics of their
<i>beaux jours</i>&mdash;made up the amount of three hundred
and twenty dollars. This was in the bank. In the
little desk that stood on a table in her room was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
five hundred dollars in gold Shackleton had sent her.
She had not touched it and never intended to, seeming
to repudiate its possession by keeping it thus secret and
apart from her other store.</p>

<p>The time was wearing on toward mid-December.
Christmas was beginning to figure in the conversation
of Miguel and Benito, and with an eye to its approach
they had both joined a Sunday-school, to which they
piously repaired every Sabbath morn. They had introduced
the question of presents in their conversations
with Mariposa with such smiling persistence that she
had finally promised them that, on her first free afternoon,
she would go down town and price certain articles
they coveted. The afternoon came within a few
days after her promise, one of her pupils sending her
word that she was invited out of town for the holidays,
and her lessons would cease till after New Year&#8217;s.</p>

<p>The pricing had evidently been satisfactory, for,
late in the afternoon, Mariposa turned her face homeward,
her hands full of small packages. It was one
of the clear, hazeless days of thin atmosphere, with
an edge of cold, that are scattered through the San
Francisco winter. There is no frost in the air, but
the chill has a searching quality which suggests winter,
as does the wild radiance of the sunset spread over the
west in a transparent wash of red. The invigorating
breath of cold made the young girl&#8217;s blood glow, and
she walked rapidly along Kearney Street, the exercise
in the sharp air causing a faint, unusual pink to tint
her cheeks. Her intention was to walk to Clay Street
and then take the cable-car, which in those days slid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
slowly up the long hills, past the Plaza and through
Chinatown.</p>

<p>She was near the Plaza, when a hail behind her fell
on her ear, and turning, she saw Barron close on her
heels, his hands also full of small packages. He had
been at the mines for two weeks, and she could but notice
the unaffected gladness of his greeting. She felt
glad, too, a circumstance of which, for some occult
reason, she was ashamed, and the shame and the gladness
combined lent a reserved and yet conscious quality
to her smile and kindled a charming embarrassment in
her eye. They stood by the curb, he looking at her
with glances of na&iuml;ve admiration, while she looked
down at her parcels. Passers-by noticed them, setting
them down, she in her humble dress, he in his unmetropolitan
roughness of aspect, as a couple from the country,
a rancher or miner and his handsome sweetheart.</p>

<p>He took her parcels away from her, and they started
forward toward the Plaza.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear me panting?&#8221; he said, laying his free
hand on his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, why should you pant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve been running all down Kearney Street
for blocks after you. I never knew any one to walk as
fast in my life. I thought even if I didn&#8217;t catch you
you&#8217;d hear me panting behind you and think it was
some new kind of fire-engine and turn round and look.
But you never wavered&mdash;simply went on like a racer
headed for the goal. Did you walk so fast because
you knew I was behind you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly with a side glance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
protest and met his eyes full of quizzical humor and
yet with a gleam of something eager and earnest in
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to walk fast in this cold air. It makes me feel
so alive. For a long time I&#8217;ve felt as though I were
half dead, and you don&#8217;t know how exhilarating it is
to feel life come creeping back. It&#8217;s like being able
to breathe freely after you&#8217;ve been almost suffocated.
But where did you see me on Kearney Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in a place buying things for the boys. I
was looking at a drum for Benito, and I just happened
to glance up, and there you were passing. I dropped
the drum and ran.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>drum</i> for Benito! Oh, Mr. Barron, don&#8217;t get
Benito a drum!&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not control his laughter at the sight of her
expression of horrified protest. He laughed so loudly
that people looked at him. She smiled herself, not
quite knowing why, and insensibly, both feeling
curiously light-hearted, they drew closer together.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I get?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I looked at knives
and guns, and I knew that they wouldn&#8217;t do. Benito
would certainly kill Miguel and probably grandma.
I thought of a bat and ball, and then I knew he&#8217;d
break all the windows. The man in the store wanted
me to buy a bow and arrow, but I saw him taking his
revenge on the crab lady. Benito&#8217;s a serious problem
any way you take him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had come to the Plaza, once an open space of
sand, round which the wild, pioneer city swept in whirlpool
currents, now already showing the lichened brick
and dropping plaster, the sober line of house-fronts, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
an aging locality. Where Chinatown backed on
the square the houses had grown oriental, their western
ugliness, disguised by the touch of gilding that, here
and there, incrusted their fronts, the swaying of crimson
lanterns, the green zigzags of dwarf trees. Over
the top of the Clay Street hill the west shone red
through smoke which filled the air with a keen, acrid
smell. It told of hearth-fires. And oozing out of a
thousand chimneys and streaming across the twilight
city it told of homes where the good wife made ready
for her man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not take the cars,&#8221; said Barron. &#8220;Let&#8217;s walk
home. Can you manage those hills?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a laughing assent, and they turned upward,
walking slowly as befitted the climb. Chinatown
opened before them like the mysterious, medieval haunt
of robbers in an old drawing. The murky night was
settling on it, shot through with red gleams at the end
of streets, where the sunset pried into its peopled
darkness. The blackness of yawning doorway and
stealthy alley succeeded the brilliancy of a gilded interior,
or a lantern-lit balcony. Strange smells were
in the air, aromatic and noisome, as though the dwellers
in this domain were concocting their wizard brews.
There was a sound of shifting feet, a chatter of guttural
voices, and a vision of faces passing from light
to shadow, marked by a weird similarity, and with eyes
like bits of onyx let into the tight-drawn skin.</p>

<p>It was an alien city, a bit of the oldest civilization in
the world, imbedded in the heart of the newest.
Touches of bizarre, of sinister picturesqueness filled it
with arresting interest. On the window-sills lilies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
their stalks bound with strips of crimson paper, grew
in blue and white china bowls filled with pebbles
round which their white roots clung. Miniature pine-trees,
in pots of brass, thrust their boughs between the
rusty ironwork of old balconies. Through an open
doorway a glimpse was given down a dark hallway,
narrow, black, a gas-jet, like a tiny golden tear, diffusing
a frightened gleam of light. From some dim
angle the glow of a blood-red lantern mottled a space
of leprous wall. On a tottering balcony a woman&#8217;s
face, rounded like a child&#8217;s, crimson lipped, crowned
with peach blossoms, looked down from shadows, the
light of a lantern catching and loosening the golden
traceries of her rich robe, the trail of peach blossoms
against her cheek.</p>

<p>The ascent was long and steep, and they walked
slowly, talking in a desultory fashion. Mariposa recounted
the trivial incidents that had taken place in
the Garcia house during her companion&#8217;s absence. As
they breasted the last hill the light grew brighter, for
the sunset still lingered in a reluctant glow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take my arm,&#8221; said Barron. &#8220;You&#8217;re out of
breath.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took it, and they began slowly to mount the last
steep blocks. She glanced up at him to smile her
thanks for his support, and met his eyes, looking intently
at her. The red light strengthened on her face
as they ascended.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve the strangest eyes,&#8221; he said suddenly. &#8220;Do
you know what they&#8217;re the color of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father used to say they were like a dog&#8217;s,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
answered, feeling unable to drop them and yet uneasy
under his unflinching gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the color of sherry&mdash;exactly the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let you see them any more if that&#8217;s the best
you can say of them,&#8221; she said, dropping them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could say they were the color of beer,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;but I thought sherry sounded better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beer!&#8221; she exclaimed, averting not only her eyes,
but her face. &#8220;That&#8217;s an insult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll only say in the simplest way what I
think. I&#8217;m not the kind of man who makes fine
speeches&mdash;they&#8217;re the most beautiful eyes in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the worst of all,&#8221; she answered, extremely
confused and not made more comfortable by the
thought that she had brought it on herself. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
leave my eyes out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll not speak of them again. But I&#8217;ll
want to see them now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw her color mounting, and in the joy of her
close proximity, loitering arm in arm up the sordid
street, he laughed again in his happiness and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When a person owns something that&#8217;s rare and
beautiful he oughtn&#8217;t to be mean about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; said the owner of the rare and
beautiful possessions, keeping them sternly out of
sight.</p>

<p>He continued to look ardently at her, not conscious
of what he was doing, his step growing slower and
slower.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long climb,&#8221; he said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;Is that why you&#8217;re going so
slowly?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>&#8220;Are we going so slowly?&#8221; he asked, and as if to
demonstrate how slow had been their progress, they
both came to a stop like a piece of run-down machinery.</p>

<p>They looked at each other for a questioning moment,
then burst into simultaneous peals of laughter.</p>

<p>One of the last and daintiest charms that nature can
give a woman is a lovely laugh. It suggests unexplored
riches of tenderness and sweetness, unrevealed
capacity for joy and pain, as a harsh and unmusical
laugh tells of an arid nature, hard, without juice, devoid
of imagination, mystery and passion. Like her
mother before her, Mariposa possessed this charm in
its highest form. The ripple of sound that flowed
from her lips was music, and it cast a spell over the
man at whose side she stood, as Lucy&#8217;s laugh, twenty-five
years before, had cast one over Dan Moreau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard you laugh before,&#8221; he said in delight.
&#8220;What can I say to make you do it again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t say anything that time,&#8221; said Mariposa.
&#8220;So I suppose the best way is for you to be silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron took her advice and surveyed her mutely
with dancing eyes. For a moment her lips, puckered
into a tremulous pout, twitched with the premonitory
symptoms of a second outburst. But she controlled
them, moved by some perverse instinct of coquetry,
while the laughter welled up in the eyes that were fixed
on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see I&#8217;ll have to make a joke,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I
can&#8217;t think of any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Garcia&#8217;s got a book full. You might borrow
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you tell me one that&#8217;s made you laugh
before and loan it to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it mightn&#8217;t work a second time. I might take
it quite solemnly. A sense of humor&#8217;s a very capricious
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the lady who&#8217;s got it is even more so,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>And then once again they laughed in concert, foolishly
and gaily and without knowing why.</p>

<p>They had gained the top of the hill, and the blaze
of red that swept across the west shone on their faces.
They were within a few minutes&#8217; walk of the house
now and they continued, arm in arm, as was the custom
of the day, and at the same loitering gait.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me your people came originally
from Eldorado County, somewhere up near Hangtown?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been up that way, and
if I&#8217;d known the place I might have stopped there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you never could have found it,&#8221; said Mariposa
hastily. &#8220;It was only a cabin miles back in the
foothills. My mother often told me of it&mdash;just a cabin
by a stream. It has probably disappeared now. My
father and mother met and were married there among
the mines, and&mdash;and&mdash;I was born there,&#8221; she ended,
stammeringly, hating the lies upon which her youthful
traditions had been built.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d known you had been born there I&#8217;d have gone
on a pilgrimage to find that cabin if it had taken a
month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you it can&#8217;t be standing yet. I&#8217;m twenty-four
years old&mdash;&#8221; she suddenly realized that this, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
was part of the necessary web of misstatement in which
she was caught. The color deepened on her face into
a conscious blush. She dropped her eyes, then raising
them to his with a curious defiance, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;that&#8217;s a mistake. I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m&mdash;more than that,
I&#8217;m twenty-five, nearly twenty-six.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron, who saw nothing in the equivocation but a
girl&#8217;s foolish desire to understate her age, burst into
delighted laughter, and pressing the hand on his arm
against his side, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I always thought you were <i>years</i> older than
that&mdash;thirty to thirty-five at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he looked with teasing eyes into her face. But
this time Mariposa did not laugh, nor even smile. The
joy had suddenly gone out of her, and she walked on
in silence, her head drooped, seeming in some mysterious
way to have grown suddenly anxious and preoccupied.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the house,&#8221; she said at length. &#8220;I was
getting tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a light in the parlor,&#8221; said Barron, as he
opened the gate. &#8220;What can be the matter? Has
Benito killed grandma, or is there a party?&#8221;</p>

<p>Their doubts on this point were soon set at rest.
Their approaching footsteps evidently were heard by
a listening ear within, for the hall door opened and
Benito appeared in the aperture.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man to see you in the parlor,&#8221; he announced
to Mariposa.</p>

<p>Inside the hallway the door on the left that led to
Mrs. Garcia&#8217;s apartments opened and the young woman
thrust out her head, and said in a hissing whisper:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s a gentleman waiting for you in the parlor,
Miss Moreau.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time Miguel imparted similar information
from the top of the stairs, and the Chinaman
appeared at the kitchen door and cried from thence,
with the laconic dryness peculiar to his race:</p>

<p>&#8220;One man see you, parlor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa stood looking from one to the other with
the raised eyebrows of inquiring astonishment. The
only person who had visitors in the Garcia house was
Pierpont, and they did not come at such a fashionably
late hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a thin, consumpted-looking young man with
eye-glasses,&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia, curling round the door
the better to project the hissing whisper she employed,
&#8220;and he said he&#8217;d wait till you came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa turned toward the parlor door, leaving the
family, with Barron, on the stairs, and the Chinaman,
peering from the kitchen regions, watching her with
tense interest, as if they half expected they would never
see her again.</p>

<p>Two of the gases in the old chandelier were lit and
cast a sickly light over the large room, which had the
close, musty smell of an unaired apartment. The last
relics of Se&ntilde;ora Garcia&#8217;s grandeur were congregated
here&mdash;bronzes that once had cost large sums of money,
a gilt console that had been brought from a rifled
French ch&acirc;teau round the Horn in a sailing ship, a
buhl cabinet with its delicate silvery inlaying gleaming
in the half-light, and two huge Japanese vases, with
blue and white dragons crawling round their necks,
flanking the fireplace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>On the edge of a chair, just under the chandelier,
sat a young man. He had his hat in his hand, and
his head drooped so that the light fell smoothly on
the crown of blond hair. He looked small and meager
in the surrounding folds of a very large and loose
ulster. As the sound of the approaching step caught
his ear he started and looked up, with the narrowed
eyes of the near-sighted, and then jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Moreau?&#8221; he said inquiringly, and extended
a long, thin hand which, closing on hers, felt to her
warm, soft grasp like a bunch of chilled sticks. She
had not the slightest idea who he was, and looking at
him under the wan light, saw he was some one from
that world of wealth with which she had so few affiliations.
Something about him&mdash;the coldness of his
hand, an indescribable trepidation of manner&mdash;suggested
to her that he was exceedingly ill at ease. She
looked at him wonderingly, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat at her bidding on the chair he had risen from,
subsiding into the small, shrunken figure in the middle
of enveloping folds of overcoat. One hand hung down
between his knees holding his hat. He looked at
Mariposa and then looked down at the hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold afternoon, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very cold,&#8221; she responded, &#8220;but I like it. I hope
you haven&#8217;t been waiting long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; he looked up at her, blinking near-sightedly
through the glasses; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you
know what my name is, Miss Moreau? It&#8217;s Shackleton&mdash;Winslow
Shackleton. I forgot my card.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa felt a lightning-like change come over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
her face, in which there was a sudden stiffening of
her features into something hard and repellent. To
Win, at that moment, she looked very like his father.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she said, hearing her voice drop at the end
of the interjection with a note of vague disapproval
and uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen you,&#8221; continued Win, &#8220;once at <i>The
Trumpet</i> office, when you were there with Mrs. Willers.
I don&#8217;t think you saw me. I was back in the corner,
near the table where Jack&mdash;that&#8217;s the boy&mdash;sits.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hardly knew what he said or what she responded.
What did <i>this</i> mean? What was going to
happen now?</p>

<p>&#8220;You must excuse my coming this way, without an
introduction or anything, but as you knew my father
and mother, I&mdash;I&mdash;thought you wouldn&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her again, anxiously, she thought,
and she said suddenly, with her habitual directness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you come from your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I came on&mdash;on&mdash;my own hook. I wanted&#8221;&mdash;he
looked vaguely about and then laid his hat on a
table near him&mdash;&#8220;I wanted to see you on business of
my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nervousness from which he was evidently suffering
began to communicate itself to Mariposa. The
Shackleton family had come to mean everything that
was painful and agitating to her, and here was a new
one wanting to talk to her about business that she
knew, past a doubt, was of some unusual character.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve come to talk to me about going to Europe,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
she said desperately, &#8220;I may as well tell you,
there&#8217;s no use. I won&#8217;t go to Paris now, as I once
said I would, and there&#8217;s no good trying to make me
change my mind. Your mother and Mrs. Willers
have both tried to, and it&#8217;s very kind of them, but I&mdash;can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had an expression at once of fright and determination.
The subject was becoming a nightmare to
her, and she saw herself attacked again from a strange
quarter, and with, she imagined, a new set of arguments.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to do with going to Europe,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&#8221;&mdash;he put up one of the long, bony hands,
and with the two first fingers pressed his glasses back
against his eyes, then dropped the hand and stared at
Mariposa, the eyes looking strangely pale and prominent
behind the powerful lenses.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s just between you and me,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>She surveyed him without answering, her brows
drawn, her mind concentrated on him and on what he
could mean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to teach somebody music?&#8221; she
said, wondering if this could be the pleasant solution
of the enigma.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. The&mdash;er&mdash;the business I&#8217;ve come to talk to
you about ought to do away altogether with the necessity
of your giving lessons.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at each other silently for a moment.
Win was conscious that his hands were trembling, and
that his mouth was dry. He rose from his chair and
mechanically reached for his hat. When he had started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
on his difficult errand he had been certain that she
knew her relationship to his father. Now the dreadful
thought entered his mind that perhaps she did not.
And even if she did, it was evident that she was not
going to give him the least help.</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>is</i> the business you&#8217;ve come to see me about?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a question of money,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money!&#8221; ejaculated Mariposa, in baffled amaze.
&#8220;What money? Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced desperately into his hat and then back
at her. She saw the hat trembling in his hand
and suddenly realized that this man was trying to say
something that was agitating him to the marrow of
his being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Shackleton,&#8221; she said, rising to her feet, &#8220;tell
me what you mean. I don&#8217;t understand. I&#8217;m completely
at sea. How can there be any question of
money between us when I&#8217;ve never seen you or met
you before? Explain it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped the hat to his side and said slowly, looking
her straight in the face:</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to give you a share of the estate left me by
my father. I look upon it as yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. He saw her paling under his
gaze, and realized that, whatever she might pretend,
she knew. His heart bled for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;As mine!&#8221; she said in a low, uncertain voice.
&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you have a right to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another pause. He moved close to her
and said, in a voice full of a man&#8217;s deep kindness:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain any more. Don&#8217;t ask it. Don&#8217;t
let&#8217;s bother about anything in the background. It&#8217;s
just the present that&#8217;s our affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suddenly dropped his hat and took her hand.
It was as cold now as his had been. He pressed it,
and Mariposa, looking dazedly at him, saw a gleam
like tears behind the glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hateful to have you living here like this, while
we&mdash;that is, while other people&mdash;have everything. I
can&#8217;t stand it. It&#8217;s too mean and unfair. I want you
to share with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, looking down, a hundred
thoughts bursting in upon her brain. What did he
know? How had he found it out? In his grasp, her
hand trembled pitifully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shake your head,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;it&#8217;s so hard to
say it. Don&#8217;t turn it down before you&#8217;ve heard me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s hard to hear it,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows anything of this but me,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and I promise you that no other ever shall.
It&#8217;ll be just between us as between&#8221;&mdash;he paused and
then added with a voice that was husky&mdash;&#8220;as between
brother and sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head again, feeling for the moment
too upset to speak, and tried to draw away from him.
But he put his other hand on her shoulder and held
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go halves with you. I can have it all arranged
so that no one will ever find out. I can&#8217;t make the
regular partition of the property until the end of the
year. But, until then, I&#8217;ll send you what would be
your interest, monthly, and you can live where, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
how, you like. I&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t go on, knowing things, and
thinking of you living in this sort of way and teaching
music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; she said, in a strangled undertone,
and pulling her hand out of his grasp. &#8220;I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s
not possible. I can&#8217;t take money that was your
father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not his&mdash;it&#8217;s mine now. Don&#8217;t let what&#8217;s
dead and buried come up and interfere.&#8221;</p>

<p>She backed away from him, still shaking her head.
She made an effort toward a cold composure, but her
pain seemed to show more clearly through it. He
looked at her, vexed, irresolute, wrung with pity, that
he knew she would not permit him to express.</p>

<p>It was impossible for them to understand each other.
She, with her secret knowledge of her mother&#8217;s lawful
claim and her own legitimacy&mdash;he regarding her as the
wronged child of his father&#8217;s sin. In her dazed distress
she only half-grasped what he thought. The
strongest feeling she had was once again to escape
the toils that these terrible people, who had so wronged
her mother, were spreading for her. They wanted
to pay her to redeem the stain on their past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Money can&#8217;t set right what was wrong,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Money can&#8217;t square things between your family and
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money can&#8217;t square anything&mdash;I don&#8217;t want it to.
I&#8217;m not trying to square things; I&#8217;ve not thought about
it that way at all. I just wanted you to have it because
it seemed all wrong for you not to. You had a right,
just as I had, and Maud had. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve
thought much about it, anyway. It just came to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
that you ought to have what was yours. I wouldn&#8217;t
make you feel bad for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then remember, once and forever, that I take nothing
from you or your people. I&#8217;d rather beg than take
money that came from your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he has nothing to do with it. It&#8217;s mine now.
I&#8217;ve done you no injury, and it&#8217;s I that want you to
take it. Won&#8217;t you take it from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke simply, almost wistfully, like a little boy.
Mariposa answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;oh, Mr. Shackleton, why don&#8217;t you and your
people let me alone? I won&#8217;t tell. I&#8217;ll keep it all a
secret. But your mother torments me to go to Europe&mdash;and
now you come! If I were starving, I wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;I
couldn&#8217;t&mdash;take anything from any of you. I think
<i>you&#8217;re</i> kind. I think you&#8217;ve just come to-day because
you were sorry. But don&#8217;t talk about it any more. Let
me be. Let me go along teaching here where I belong.
Forget me. Forget that you ever saw me. Forget the
miserable tie of blood there is between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the thing I can&#8217;t forget. That&#8217;s the thing
that worries me. It&#8217;s not the past. I&#8217;ve nothing to
do with that. It&#8217;s the present that&#8217;s my affair. I can&#8217;t
have everything while you have nothing. It don&#8217;t seem
to me it&#8217;s like a man to act that way. It goes against
me, anyhow. I don&#8217;t offer you this because of anything
in the past; that&#8217;s my father&#8217;s affair. I don&#8217;t
know anything about it. I offer it because I&mdash;I&mdash;I&#8221;&mdash;he
stammered over the unfamiliar words and finally
jerked out&mdash;&#8220;because I want to give back what belongs
to you. That&#8217;s all there is to it. Please take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked directly into his eyes and said, gravely:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m sorry if it&#8217;s a disappointment, but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she suddenly looked down, her face began to
quiver, and she said in a broken undertone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about it any more; it hurts me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Win turned quickly away from her and picked up
his hat. He was confused and disappointed, and relieved,
too, for he had done the most difficult piece of
work of his life. But, at the moment, his most engrossing
feeling was sympathy for this girl, so bravely
drawing her pride together over the bleeding of her
heart.</p>

<p>She murmured a response in a steadier voice and
he turned toward her. Had any of his society friends
been by they would hardly have known him. The
foolish manner behind which he sheltered his shy and
sensitive nature was gone. He was grave and looked
very much of a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course, it&#8217;s for you to say what you want.
But there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;d like you to promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To promise?&#8221; she said uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and to keep it, too. And that is, if you ever
want anything&mdash;help in any way; if you get blue
in your spirits, or some one&#8217;s not doing the straight
thing by you, or gone back on you&mdash;to come to me.
I&#8217;m not much in some ways, but I guess I could be of
use. And, anyway, it&#8217;s good for a girl to have some
friend that she can count on, who&#8217;s a man. And&#8221;&mdash;he
paused with the door-handle in his hand&mdash;&#8220;and now
you know me, anyway, and that&#8217;s something. Will
you promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll promise that,&#8221; said Mariposa, and moving
toward him she gave him her hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>He pressed it, dropped it, and opened the door. A
moment later Mariposa heard the hall door bang behind
him. She sat down in the chair from which she
had risen, her hands lying idle in her lap, her eyes on
a rose in the carpet, trying to think, to understand
what it meant.</p>

<p>She did not hear the door open or notice Benito&#8217;s
entrance, which was accomplished with some disturbance,
as he was astride a cane. His spirited course
round the room, the end of the cane coming in violent
contact with the pieces of furniture that impeded his
route, was of so boisterous a nature that it roused her.
She looked absently at him, and saw him wreathed in
smiles. Having gained her attention, he brought his
steed toward her with some ornamental prancings. She
noticed that he held a pair of gloves in his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man what came to see you,&#8221; he said, &#8220;left this
cane. It was in the hat-rack, and I came out first, so I
swiped it. I took these for Miguel&#8221;&mdash;he flourished
the gloves&mdash;&#8220;but the cane&#8217;s mine all right. Come in
to supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he wheeled away with a bridling step, the end
of his cane rasping on the worn ribs of the carpet.
Mariposa, mechanically following him, heard his triumphant
cries as he entered the dining-room and then
his sudden wails of wrath as Miguel expressed his disapprobation
of the division of the spoils in the vigorous
manner of innocent childhood.</p>

<p>Had Essex realized that Mrs. Willers was an adverse
agent in his pursuit of Mariposa, he would not
have greeted her with the urbane courteousness that
marked their meetings. He was a man of many
manners, and he never would have wasted one of his
best on the newspaper woman, to him essentially uninteresting
and unattractive, unless he had intended
thereby to further his own ends. Mrs. Willers he
knew to be a friend of Mariposa&#8217;s, and he thought it
a wise policy to keep in her good graces. He made
that mistake, so often the undoing of those who are
unscrupulous and clever, of not crediting Mrs. Willers
with her full amount of brains. He had seen
her foolish side, and he knew that she was a good
journalist of the hustling, energetic, unintellectual
type, but he saw no deeper.</p>

<p>Since their meeting in the park and her unequivocal
rejection of him his feeling for Mariposa had augmented
in force and fire until it had full possession of
him. He was of the order of men whom easy conquests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
cool. Now added to the girl&#8217;s own change of
front was the overwhelming inducement of the
wealth she represented. His original idea of Mariposa
as a handsome mistress that he would take to
France and there put on the operatic stage, of whom
he would be the proud owner, while they toured
Europe together, her voice and beauty charming
kings, had been abandoned since the night of his talk
with Harney. He would marry her, and, with her
completely under his dominion, he would turn upon
the Shackleton estate and make her claim. He supposed
her to be in entire ignorance of her parentage,
and his first idea had been to marry her and not lighten
this ignorance till she was safely in his power. He
had a fear of her shrinking before the hazards of the
enterprise, but he was confident that, once his, all
scruples, timidity and will would give way before him.</p>

<p>But her refusal of him had upset these calculations,
and her coldness and repugnance had been as oil to the
flame of his passion. He was enraged with himself
and with her. He thought of the night in the cottage
and cursed himself for his precipitation, and his gods
for the ill luck that, too late, had revealed to him her
relationship to the dead millionaire. At first he had
thought the offer of marriage would obliterate all unpleasant
memories. But her manner that day in the
park had frightened him. It was not the haughty
manner, adopted to conceal hidden fires, of the woman
who still loves. There had been a chill poise about
her that suggested complete withdrawal from his influence.</p>

<p>Since then he had cogitated much. He foresaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
that it was going to be very difficult to see and have
speech of her. An occasional walk up Third Street
to Sutter with Mrs. Willers kept him informed of
her movements and doings. Had he guessed that
Mrs. Willers, with her rouge higher up on one cheek
than the other, the black curls of her bang sprawlingly
pressed against her brow by a spotted veil, was quite
conversant with his pretensions and their non-success,
he would have been more guarded in his exhibition of
interest. As it was, Mrs. Willers wrote to Mariposa
after one of these walks in which Essex&#8217;s questions
had been carelessly numerous and frank, and told her
that he was still &#8220;camped on her trail, and for goodness&#8217;
sake not to weaken.&#8221; Mariposa tore up the letter
with an angry ejaculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to weaken!&#8221; she said to herself. If she had
only dared to tell Mrs. Willers the whole instead of
half the truth!</p>

<p>The difficulty of seeing Mariposa was further intensified
by the fullness of his own days. He had little
time to spare. The new proprietor worked his
people for all there was in them and paid them well.
Several times on the regular weekly holiday the superior
men on <i>The Trumpet</i> were given, he loitered
along streets where she had been wont to pass. But
he never saw her. The chance that had favored him
that once in the park was not repeated. Mrs. Willers
said she was very busy. Essex began to wonder if
she suspected him of lying in wait for her and was
taking her walks along unfrequented byways.</p>

<p>Finally, after Christmas had passed and he had
still not caught a glimpse of her, he determined to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
her in the only way that seemed possible. He had
inherited certain traditions of good breeding from
his mother, and it offended this streak of delicacy
and decency that was still faintly discernible in his
character to intrude upon a lady who had so obviously
shown a distaste for his society. But there was nothing
else for it. Interests that were vital were at
stake. Moreover, his desire, for love&#8217;s sake, to see
her again was overmastering. Her face came between
him and his work. There were nights when he
stood opposite the Garcia house watching for her
shadow on the blind.</p>

<p>He timed his visit at an hour when, according to the
information extracted from Mrs. Willers, Mariposa&#8217;s
last pupil for the day should have left. He loitered
about at the corner of the street and saw the pupil&mdash;one
of the grown-up ones in a sealskin sack and a black
Gainsborough hat&mdash;open the gate and sweep majestically
down the street. Then he strode from his
coign of vantage, stepped lightly up the stairs, and
rang the bell.</p>

<p>It was after school hours, and Benito opened the
door. Essex, in his silk hat and long, dark overcoat,
tall and distinguished, was so much more impressive
a figure than Win that the little boy stared at him
in overawed surprise, and only found his breath when
the stranger demanded Miss Moreau.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s in,&#8221; said Benito, backing away toward
the stairs; &#8220;I&#8217;ll call her. She has quite a lot of callers
sometimes,&#8221; he hazarded pleasantly.</p>

<p>The door near by opened a crack, and a female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
voice issued therefrom in a suppressed tone of irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Benito, why don&#8217;t you show the gentleman into
the parlor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll go in if he wants,&#8221; said Benito, who evidently
had decided that the stranger knew how to take
care of himself; &#8220;that&#8217;s the door; just open it and go
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex, who was conscious that the eye which pertained
to the voice was surveying him intently through
the crack, did as he was bidden and found himself in
the close, musty parlor. It was late in the afternoon,
and the long lace curtains draped over the windows
obscured the light. He wanted to see Mariposa
plainly and he looped the curtains back against the
brass hooks. His heart was beating hard with expectation.
As he turned round to look at the door
he noticed that the key was in the lock, and resolved,
with a sense of grim determination, that if she tried
to go when she saw who it was, he could be before
her and turn the key.</p>

<p>Upstairs Benito had found Mariposa sitting in front
of the fire. She had been giving lessons most of the
day and was tired. She stretched herself like a
sleepy cat as he came in, and put her hand up to her
hair, pushing in the loosened hairpins.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some one about lessons, I guess,&#8221; she said,
rising and giving a hasty look in the glass. &#8220;At this
rate, Ben, I&#8217;ll soon be rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do then?&#8221; said Benito, clattering to
the stair-head beside her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll buy a steam yacht, just you and I, and
travel round the world. And we&#8217;ll stop in all sorts of
strange countries and ride on elephants and buy parrots,
and shoot tigers and go up in balloons and do
everything that&#8217;s dangerous and interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was in good spirits at the prospect of a new
pupil, and, with her hand on the door-knob, threw
Benito a farewell smile, which was still on her lips as
she entered.</p>

<p>It remained there for a moment, for at the first
glance she did not recognize Essex, who was standing
with his back to the panes of the unveiled windows;
then he moved toward her and she saw who
it was.</p>

<p>She gave a smothered exclamation and drew back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Essex!&#8221; she said; &#8220;why do you come here?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had intended to meet her with his customary
half impudent, half cajoling suavity, but found that
he could not. The sight of her filled him with fiery
agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came because I couldn&#8217;t keep away,&#8221; he said,
advancing with his hand out.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, glancing at the hand and turning
her head aside with an impatient movement; &#8220;there
can&#8217;t be any pretenses at friendship between us. I
don&#8217;t want to shake hands with you. I don&#8217;t want
to see you. What did you come for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To see you. I had to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes, fixed on her as she stood in the light of
the window, seemed to italicize the words of the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use beginning that subject again,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
said hurriedly; &#8220;there&#8217;s no use talking about those
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What things? What are you referring to?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she felt the old helpless feeling coming
over her, but she forced it aside and said, looking
steadily at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;The things we talked about in the park the last
time we met.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw his dark face flush. He was too much in
earnest now to be able to assert his supremacy by
teasing equivocations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve come to-day to repeat those
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said quickly; &#8220;there&#8217;s no use.
I won&#8217;t listen to them. It&#8217;s not polite to intrude into
a lady&#8217;s house and try to talk about subjects she detests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The time has passed for us to be polite or impolite,&#8221;
he answered hotly; &#8220;we&#8217;re not the man and woman
as society and the world has made them. We&#8217;re the
man and woman as they are and have always been
from the beginning. We&#8217;re not speaking to each
other through the veils of conventionality; we&#8217;re
speaking face to face. We have hearts and souls and
passions. We&#8217;ve loved each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; she said; &#8220;never for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a bad memory,&#8221; he answered slowly;
&#8220;is it natural or cultivated?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had the satisfaction of seeing her color rise.
The sight sent a thrill of hope through him. He
moved nearer to her and said in a voice that vibrated
with feeling:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>&#8220;You loved me once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, never, never. It was never that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why,&#8221; he answered, his lips trying to twist
themselves into a sardonic smile, while rage possessed
him, &#8220;why did you&mdash;let us say&mdash;encourage me so
that night in the cottage on Pine Street?&#8221;</p>

<p>Though her color burned deeper, her eyes did not
drop. He had never seen her dominating her own
girlish impulses like this. It seemed to remove her
thousands of miles from the circle of his power.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;I was lonely and
miserable, and you seemed the only creature that I
had to care for. I thought you were fond of me, and
I thought it was wonderful that any one as clever as
you could really care for me. That you regarded me
as you did I could no more have imagined than I
could have suspected you of picking my pocket or
murdering me. And that night in the cottage, when
in my loneliness and distress I seemed to be holding
out my arms to you, asking you to protect and comfort
me, you laughed at me and struck me a blow in
the face. It was the end of my dream. I wakened
then and saw the reality. But you&mdash;you as you are&mdash;as
I know you now&mdash;I never loved, I never could have
loved.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words inflamed his rage, not alone against her,
but against himself, who had had her in this pliant
mood in his very arms and had lost her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And was it only a desire for consolation and sympathy
that made you behave toward me in what was
hardly&mdash;a&mdash;&#8221; he paused as if hesitating for a word
that would in a seemly manner express his thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
in reality racking his brains for the one that would
hurt her most&mdash;&#8220;hardly a maidenly way considering
your lack of interest in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The word he had chosen told. Her color sank suddenly
away, leaving her very pale. Her face seemed
to stiffen and lose its youthful curves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;that it&#8217;s necessary
to continue this conversation. It doesn&#8217;t seem to me
to be very profitable to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, but he made no movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to excuse me, Mr. Essex,&#8221; she said,
moving toward the door, &#8220;but if you won&#8217;t go I
must.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expected had happened. He sprang before her
and locked the door. Leaning his back against it, he
stared at her. Both were now very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, hearing his own voice shaken by his
rapid breathing, &#8220;you&#8217;re not going. I&#8217;ve not said
half I came to say. I&#8217;ve not come to-day to plead
and sue like a beggar for the love that you&#8217;re ready
to give one day and take back the next. I&#8217;ve other
things to talk about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door,&#8221; she commanded; &#8220;open the door
and let me out. I want to hear nothing that you have
to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to hear who you are?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The words passed through Mariposa like a current
of electricity. Every nerve in her body seemed to
tighten. She looked at him, staring and repeating:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear who I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, leaning toward her while one hand
still gripped the door-handle; &#8220;hear what your real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
name is, and who you are? Hear who your father
was and where you were born?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face blanched under his eyes. The sight
pleased him, suggesting as it did weakness and fear
that would give him back his old ascendancy. Horror
invaded her. He, of all people on earth, to know! She
could say nothing; could hardly think; only seemed
a thing of ears to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear who my father was!&#8221; she repeated, this time
almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I can tell you all that, and more, too. I&#8217;ve
got a wonderfully interesting story for you. You&#8217;ll
not want to go when I begin. Sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know? Tell me quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be impatient. It&#8217;s a long story. It begins
on the Nevada desert. That&#8217;s where you were born;
not in the cabin in Eldorado County, as I heard you
telling Jake Shackleton that day at Mrs. Willers&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was watching her like a tiger, still standing
with his back against the door. Her eyes were on
him, wild and intent. Each word fell like a drop of
vitriol on her brain. She saw that he knew everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother was Lucy Fraser, but your father
was not Dan Moreau. He was a very different man,
and you were his eldest child, his eldest and only
legitimate child. Do you know what his name was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mariposa in a low voice; &#8220;Jake Shackleton.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Essex&#8217;s turn to be amazed. He stared at
her, speechless, completely staggered.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;DON&#8217;T YOU WANT TO HEAR WHO YOU ARE?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>&#8220;You know it?&#8221; he cried, starting forward toward
her; &#8220;you know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood glaring, trying to collect his senses and
grasp in one whirling moment what difference her
knowledge would make to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How&mdash;how&mdash;did you know it?&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not of any consequence. I know that I am
Jake Shackleton&#8217;s eldest living child; that my mother
was married twice; that I was born in the desert instead
of in Eldorado County. I know it all. And what
is there so odd about that?&#8221; She threw her head up
and looked with baffling coldness into his eyes. &#8220;Why
shouldn&#8217;t I know my own parentage and birthplace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; he continued to speak with eager
unsteadiness&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ve done nothing yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done nothing yet,&#8221; she repeated; &#8220;what should I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said hastily, evidently relieved;
&#8220;you couldn&#8217;t do anything alone. There must
be some one to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both had forgotten the quarrel, the locked door,
the fever pitch of ten minutes earlier. All other
thoughts had been crowded out of Mariposa&#8217;s mind
by the horrible discovery of Essex&#8217;s knowledge, and
by the apprehensions that were cold in her heart.
She shrank from him more than ever, but had no desire
now to leave the room. Instead, she persisted in
her remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me do what? I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>&#8220;Help you in establishing your claim. And fate
has put into my hands the very person, the one person
who can do that. You know there was a man
who was in the cabin with Moreau&mdash;a partner. Did
you ever hear of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, swallowing dryly. Her sense of apprehension
strengthened with his every word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have that man under my hand. He and
Mrs. Shackleton are the only living witnesses of the
transaction whereby your mother and you passed into
Moreau&#8217;s keeping. And I have him. I&#8217;ve got him
here.&#8221; He made a gesture with his thumb as though
pressing the ball of it down on something. Then he
looked at Mariposa with eyes full of an eager cupidity.</p>

<p>She did not respond with the show of interest he
had expected, but stood looking down, pale and motionless.
Her brain was in an appalled chaos from
which stood out only a few facts. This terrible man
knew her secret&mdash;the secret of her mother&#8217;s life and
honor&mdash;that she would have died to hide in the sacredness
of her love for the dead man and woman
who could no longer defend themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems as if fate had sent me to help you,&#8221; he
went on; &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t do it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; she asked without moving.</p>

<p>&#8220;Establish your claim as the real heir. Of course
you&#8217;re the chief heir. I&#8217;ve been looking it up. The
others will get a share as acknowledged children.
But you ought to get the bulk of the fortune as the
only legitimate child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Establish my claim?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Do you
mean, prove that I&#8217;m Jake Shackleton&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>&#8220;Yes. And there&#8217;s a tremendously important point.
Did your mother have papers or letters showing that
she had been Shackleton&#8217;s wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She left her marriage certificate,&#8221; she said dully,
hardly conscious of her words. &#8220;I have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here?&mdash;by you?&#8221; with quick curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; upstairs&mdash;in my little desk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he said, with almost a laugh of relief. &#8220;That
settles it. You with the certificate and I with Harney!
Why, we&#8217;ve got them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; she said, looking up as though waking.
&#8220;We?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; we,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>He had come close to her and, standing at her side,
bent his head in order to look more directly into her
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ought to put an end, dear, to your objections,&#8221;
he said gently; &#8220;you can&#8217;t do it alone. No
woman could, much less one like you&mdash;young, inexperienced,
ignorant of the world. You&#8217;ve got no idea
what a big contest like this means. There must be a
man to help you, and I must be that man, Mariposa.
We can marry quietly as soon as you are ready. It
would be better not to make any move until after that,
as it would be much easier for me to conduct the
campaign as your husband than as your fianc&eacute;. I&#8217;d
take the whole thing off your shoulders. You&#8217;d have
almost nothing to do, except be certain of your memories
and dates, and I&#8217;d see to it that you were letter
perfect in that when the time came. I&#8217;d stand between
you and everything that was disagreeable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>He took her hand, which for the moment was passive
in his.</p>

<p>&#8220;When will it be?&#8221; he said, giving it a gentle
squeeze; &#8220;when, sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>She tore her hand away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you&#8217;re crazy,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;There&#8217;ll never
be any of it. Never be any claim made or contest, or
anything that you talk of. You want me to make
money out of my mother&#8217;s story that was a tragedy&mdash;that
I can hardly think of myself! Oh!&mdash;&#8221; She
turned around, speechless, and put her hand to her
mouth.</p>

<p>She thought of her dying mother, and grief for that
smitten soul, so deeply loved, so tenderly loving, rent
her with a throe of pity, poignant as bodily pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother is dead,&#8221; he said, understanding her
and feeling some real sympathy for her. &#8220;It can&#8217;t
hurt her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drag it all out into the light,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Fight
in a court with those horrible Shackletons! Have it
in the papers and all the mean, low people in California,
who couldn&#8217;t for one moment understand anything
that was pure and noble, jeering and talking
over my father and mother! That&#8217;s what you call
establishing my claim, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not all of it,&#8221; he stammered, taken aback
by her violence. &#8220;And, anyway, it&#8217;s all true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll lie and say it was false. If it came
to fighting I&#8217;d say it was false. That I was not Jake
Shackleton&#8217;s daughter, and that my mother never
knew him, or saw him, or heard of him. I&#8217;d burn that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
certificate and say there never was such a thing, and
that anybody who suggested it was a liar or a madman.
And when it comes to you, there&#8217;s just one thing to
say: I wouldn&#8217;t marry you if forty fortunes hung
on it. I&#8217;d rather beg or steal than be your wife if
you owned all the Comstock mines. That&#8217;s the future
you think is going to tempt me&mdash;you for a husband
and a fortune for us both, made by proving that my
mother was never really married to the man I called
my father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but,&#8221; he said, not heeding her anger in his
bewildered amazement, &#8220;you intended it sooner or
later yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&mdash;I?&mdash;Betray my parents for money? <i>I</i> do
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at him, with eyes of wild indignation.
He began to have a cold comprehension of what she
felt, and it shook him as violently as his passion for
her had ever done.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;This is
not a matter of thousands; it&#8217;s millions, and it&#8217;s yours
by right. It&#8217;s a colossal fortune here in your hand&mdash;yours
almost for the asking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will never be mine. I wouldn&#8217;t have it. Oh,
let me go! This is too horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait&mdash;just one moment. If it came to an actual
suit it might be painful and trying for you. But how
if I can arrange a compromise with Mrs. Shackleton?
I think I can. When she knows that you have the
proofs of the marriage she&#8217;ll be glad enough to settle.
She doesn&#8217;t want these things to come out any more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
than you do. She&#8217;s a smart woman, and she&#8217;ll know
that your silence is the most valuable thing she can
buy. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand just one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the second time they looked at each other for
a motionless, deep-breathing moment. There was
nothing in their faces or attitudes that suggested
lovers. They looked like a pair of antagonists at
pause in their struggle&mdash;on the alert for a continuance
of battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand you now,&#8221; she said in a low
voice; &#8220;you&#8217;ve made me understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only want to make you understand one thing&mdash;how
much I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back with a movement of violent repugnance.
He suddenly stretched out his arms and came
toward her.</p>

<p>She ran toward the door, for the moment forgetting
it was locked. Then, as it resisted, memory awoke.
He was beside her and tried to take her in his arms,
but she turned and struck him, with all her force, a
blow on the face. She saw the skin redden under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door!&#8221; she gasped; &#8220;open the door!&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment the blow so stunned and enraged
him that he drew back from her, his hand instinctively
rising to the smarting skin. An oath burst from his
compressed mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to kill you for that,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door,&#8221; she almost shrieked, rattling the
handle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you for this. You seem to forget that I
know all the disreputable secrets of your beginnings.
I can tell all the world how your mother was sold to
Dan Moreau, and how&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa heard the click of the gate and a step on
the outside stairs. She drowned the sound of Essex&#8217;s
voice in a sudden furious pounding on the door, while
she cried with the full force of her lungs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Benito! Miguel! Mrs. Garcia!&mdash;Come and open
this door! Come and let me out! I&#8217;m locked in!
Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex was at the door in an instant, the key in the
lock. As he turned it he gave her a murderous look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; he said under his breath.</p>

<p>As the portal swung open and he passed into the
hall, the front door was violently pushed inward, and
Barron almost fell against him in the hurry of his
entrance.</p>

<p>The new-comer drew back from the departing
stranger with an apologetic start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon,&#8221; he said bruskly, &#8220;but I thought
I heard some one scream in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scream?&#8221; said Essex, languidly selecting his hat
from the disreputable collection on the rack; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
notice it, and I&#8217;ve been sitting in there for nearly an
hour with Miss Moreau. I fancy you&#8217;ve made a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I must have. It&#8217;s odd.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hall door slammed behind Essex, and the other
man turned into the parlor, where the light was now
very dim. In his exit from the room Essex had flung
the door open with violence, and Mariposa, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
backed against the wall, was still standing behind it.
As Barron pushed it to he saw her, a vague black
figure with white hands and face, in the dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you doing there?&#8221; he said;
&#8220;standing behind the door like a child in the corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thanked heaven for the friendly dark and answered
hurriedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&#8217;t want you to catch me. I&#8217;m so&mdash;so&mdash;untidy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Untidy? I never saw you untidy, and don&#8217;t believe
you ever were. I met a man in the hall, who
said he&#8217;d been here for an hour. You must have
been playing puss in the corner with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; his name&#8217;s Essex, and he&#8217;s a friend of Mrs.
Willers&#8217; that I know. He was here, and I thought
he&#8217;d come about music lessons, so I came down looking
rather untidy. That was how it happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he stayed an hour talking about music lessons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;oh, no; other things.&#8221;</p>

<p>They turned into the hall, Barron, in his character
of general guardian of the Garcia fortunes, shutting
the door of the state apartment. He had the appearance
of taking no notice of Mariposa, but as soon as
he got into the light of the hall gas he sent a lightning-like
glance over her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was funny,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but as I came up the
steps I thought I heard some one calling out. I
dashed in and fell into the arms of your music-lesson
man, who said no cries of any kind had disturbed the
joy of his hour in your society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mariposa had begun to ascend the stairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;Cries?&#8221; she said over her shoulder; &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
there were any cries. Why should any one cry out
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what I wanted to know,&#8221; he said,
watching her ascending back.</p>

<p>She turned and passed out of sight at the top of
the stairs. Barron stood below under the hall gas,
his head drooped. He was puzzled, for, say what they
might, he was certain he had heard cries.</p>

<p>At <i>The Trumpet</i> office the next morning Essex
found a letter awaiting him. It was from Mrs.
Shackleton, asking him to dinner on a certain evening
that week&mdash;&#8220;very informally, Mr. Essex would understand,
as the family was in such deep mourning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex turned the letter over, smiling to himself. It
was an admirable testimony to Bessie&#8217;s capability. Her
monogram, gilded richly, adorned the top of the sheet
of cream-laid paper, and beneath it, in a fine running
hand, were the few carefully-worded sentences, and
then the signature&mdash;Bessie A. Shackleton. It was a
remarkable letter, considering all things; wonderful
testimony to that adaptive cleverness which is the birth-right
of Bessie&#8217;s countrywomen. In her case this
care of externals had not been a haphazard acquirement.
She was not the woman to be slipshod or
trust to the tutoring of experience. When her husband&#8217;s
star had begun to rise with such dazzling effulgence
she had hired teachers for herself, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
those for Maud, and there were many books of etiquette
on the shelves in her boudoir.</p>

<p>The letter contained more for Essex than a simple
invitation to dinner. It was the first move of the
Shackleton faction in the direction he desired to see
them take. Bessie had evidently heard something that
had made her realize he, too, might be more than a
pawn in the game. He answered the note with a sentence
of acceptance and a well-turned phrase, expressing
his pleasure at the thought of meeting her again.</p>

<p>He was not in an agreeable frame of mind. His
interview with Mariposa had roused the sleeping devil
within him, which, of late, had only been drowsy. His
worst side&mdash;ugly traits inherited from his rascally
father&mdash;was developing with overmastering force.
Lessons learned in those obscure and unchronicled
years when he had swung between London and Paris
were beginning to bear fruit. At the blow from Mariposa
a crop of red-veined passions had burst into life
and grown with the speed of Jack&#8217;s beanstalk. His
face burned with the memory of that blow. When he
recalled its stinging impact, he did not know whether
he loved or hated Mariposa most. But his determination
to force her to marry him strengthened with her
openly expressed abhorrence. The memory of her
face as she struck at him was constantly before his
mental vision, and his fury seethed to the point of a
still, level-brimming tensity, when he recalled the fear
and hatred in it.</p>

<p>The dinner at Mrs. Shackleton&#8217;s was a small and
informal one. The company of six&mdash;for, besides himself,
the only guests were the Count de Lamolle and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
Pussy Thurston&mdash;looked an exceedingly meager array
in the vast drawing-room, whose stately proportions
were rendered even larger by mirrors which rose from
the floor to the cornice, elongating the room by many
shadowy reflections. A small fire burned at each end,
under mantels of Mexican onyx, and these two little
palpitating hearts of heat were the brightest spots in
the spacious apartment where even Miss Thurston&#8217;s
dress of pale-blue gauze seemed to melt into the effacing
shadows.</p>

<p>The Count de Lamolle gave Essex a quick glance,
and, as they stood together in front of one of the fires&mdash;the
two girls and Win having moved away to look
at a painting of Bouguereau&#8217;s on an easel&mdash;addressed
a casual remark to him in French. The count had already
met the newspaper man, and set him down,
without illusion or hesitation, as a clever adventurer.
He overcame his surprise at meeting him in the house
of the bonanza widow, by the reflection that this was
the United States where all men are equal, and women
with money free to be wooed by any of them.</p>

<p>The count was in an uncertain and almost uncomfortable
state of mind. The letter he had received
from Mrs. Shackleton, bidding him to the feast, was
the second from her since Maud&#8217;s rejection of him.
The first had been of a consolatory and encouraging
nature. Mrs. Shackleton told him that Maud was
young, and that many women said no, when they
meant yes. The count knew both these things as well
as Mrs. Shackleton; the latter, even better. But it
seemed to him that Maud, young though she was, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
not meant yes, and the handsome Frenchman was not
the man to force his attentions on any woman. He
watched her without appearing to notice her. She
had been greatly embarrassed at sight of him, and only
for the briefest moment let her cold fingers touch his
palm. Under the flood of light from the dining-room
chandelier she looked plainer than ever; her lack of
color and stolid absence of animation being even more
noticeable than usual in contrast with the brilliant
pink and white prettiness of Pussy Thurston, who
chattered gaily with everybody, and attempted a little
French with De Lamolle.</p>

<p>Maud sat beside Essex, and even that easily fluent
gentleman found her difficult to interest. She appeared
dull and unresponsive. Looking at her with
slightly narrowed eyes, he wondered how the count,
of whose name and exploits he had often heard in
Paris, could contemplate so brave an act as marrying
her.</p>

<p>The count, who, having more heart, could see deeper,
asked himself if the girl was really unhappy. As he
listened to Miss Thurston&#8217;s marvelous French he wondered,
with a little expanding heat of irritation, if the
mother was trying to force the marriage against the
daughter&#8217;s wish. He had broken hearts in his day,
but it was not a pastime he found agreeable. He was
too gallant a gentleman to woo where his courtship
was unwelcome.</p>

<p>When the gentlemen entered the drawing-room from
their after-dinner wine and cigars, they found the ladies
seated by one of the fires below the Mexican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
onyx mantels. Bessie rose as they approached and,
turning to Essex, asked him if he had seen the Bouguereau
on the easel, and steered him toward it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was one of Mr. Shackleton&#8217;s last purchases,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;he was very anxious to have a fine collection.
He had great taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her companion, looking at the plump, pearly-skinned
nymph and her attendant cupids, thought of
Harney&#8217;s description of Shackleton in the days when
he had first entered California, and said, with conviction:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a remarkably versatile man your husband
was! I had no idea he was interested in art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he loved it,&#8221; said Bessie, &#8220;and knew a great
deal about it. We were in Europe two years ago for
six months, and Mr. Shackleton and I visited a great
many studios. That is a Meissonier over there, and
that one we bought from Rosa Bonheur. She&#8217;s an interesting
woman, looked just like a man. Then in
the Moorish room there&#8217;s a G&eacute;r&ocirc;me. Would you like
to see it? It&#8217;s considered a very fine example.&#8221;</p>

<p>He expressed his desire to see the G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, and
followed Bessie&#8217;s rustling wake into the Moorish room.
The little room was warm, with its handful of fire, and
softly lit with chased and perforated lanterns of bronze
and brass. The heat had drawn the perfume from the
bowls full of roses and violets that stood about and
the air was impregnated with their sweetness. The
G&eacute;r&ocirc;me, a scene in the interior of a harem, with a
woman dancing, stood on an easel in one corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Bessie, drawing to one side that
he might see it better. &#8220;One on the same sort of subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
was in the studio when we first went there, but
Mr. Shackleton thought it was too small, and this was
painted to order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Superb,&#8221; murmured Essex; &#8220;G&eacute;r&ocirc;me at his best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We hoped,&#8221; continued Bessie, sinking into a seat,
&#8220;to have a fine collection, and build a gallery for them
out in the garden. There was plenty of room, and
they would have shown off better all together that
way, rather than scattered about like this. But I&#8217;ve
no ambition to do it now, and they&#8217;ll stay as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go on with the collection?&#8221; said
the young man, taking a seat on a square stool of
carved teak wood. &#8220;It would be a most interesting
thing to do, and you could go abroad every year or
two, and go to the studios and buy direct from the
artists. It&#8217;s much the best way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, with a little shrug; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know enough about it. I only know what I like,
and I generally like the wrong thing. I&#8217;m not versatile
like my husband. When I first came to California
I didn&#8217;t know a chromo from an oil painting. In fact,&#8221;
she said, looking at him frankly and laughing a little,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever seen an oil painting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex returned the laugh and murmured a word or
two of complimentary disbelief. He was wondering
when she would get to the real subject of conversation
which had led them to the G&eacute;r&ocirc;me and the Moorish
room. She was nearer than he thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a temptation to go to Paris every year
or two,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the most delightful place in
the world. It&#8217;s your home, isn&#8217;t it? So, of course,
you agree with me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>&#8220;Yes, I was born there, and have lived there off and
on ever since. To me, there is only one Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And can you fancy any one having the chance to
go there, and live and study, with no trouble about
money, refusing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex looked into the fire, and responded in a tone
that suggested polite indifference:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s quite beyond my powers of imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a sort of&mdash;I think you call it prot&eacute;g&eacute;e&mdash;isn&#8217;t
that the word?&mdash;yes&#8221;&mdash;in answer to his nod&mdash;&#8220;whom I
want to send to Paris. She&#8217;s a young girl with a fine
voice. Mr. Shackleton was very much interested in
her. He knew her father in the mining days of the
early fifties and wanted to pay off some old scores by
helping the daughter. And now the daughter seems
to dislike being helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are such people,&#8221; said Essex in the same
tone. &#8220;Does she dislike the idea of going to Paris,
too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That seems to be it. We both wanted to send her
there, have her voice trained, and put her in the way
of becoming a singer. Lepine, when he was here,
heard her and thought she had the making of a prima
donna. But,&#8221; she suddenly looked at him with a half-puzzled
expression of inquiry, &#8220;I think you know her&mdash;Miss
Moreau?&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex looked back at her for a moment with bafflingly
expressionless eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know her. She&#8217;s a friend of Mrs. Willers&#8217;,
one of the Sunday edition people on <i>The Trumpet</i>. A
very handsome and charming girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the girl,&#8221; said Bessie, mentally admiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
his perfect aplomb. &#8220;She&#8217;s a very fine girl, and, as
you say, handsome. But I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s got much
common sense. Girls don&#8217;t, as a rule, have more than
enough to get along on. But when they&#8217;re poor, and
so alone in the world, they ought to pick up a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, to refuse an offer such as you speak of,
argues a lack of something. Have you any idea of
her reason for refusing?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Bessie as he propounded the question,
his eyelids lowered slightly. She, in her turn, let her
keen gray glance rest on him. The thought flashed
through her mind that it was only another evidence
of Mariposa&#8217;s peculiarity of disposition that she should
have refused so handsome and attractive a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;&#8221; she said with unruffled placidity, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
understand it. She&#8217;s a proud girl and objects to being
under obligations. But then this wouldn&#8217;t be an obligation.
Apart from everything else, there&#8217;s no question
about obligations where singers and artists and
people like that are concerned. It&#8217;s all a matter of
art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Art levels all things,&#8221; said the young man glibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I always thought. But Miss Moreau
doesn&#8217;t seem to agree with me. The most curious
part of it all is that she was willing to go in the beginning.
That was before her mother died; then she suddenly
changed her mind, wouldn&#8217;t hear of it, and said
she&#8217;d prefer staying here in San Francisco, teaching
music at fifty cents a lesson. I must say I was annoyed.
I had her here and talked to her quite severely,
but it didn&#8217;t seem to make any impression. I
was puzzled to death to understand it. But after thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
for a while, and wondering what could make a
girl prefer San Francisco and teaching music at fifty
cents a lesson, to Paris and being a prima donna, I
came to the conclusion there was only one thing could
influence a woman to that extent&mdash;there was a man in
the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw Essex, whose eyes were on the fire, raise
his brows by way of a polite commentary on her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds a very plausible solution of the problem,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Love&#8217;s a deadly enemy to common
sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way it seemed to me. She had fallen in
love, and evidently the man had not enough money to
marry on, or was in a poor position, or something.
When I thought of that I was certain I&#8217;d found the
clue. The silly girl was going to give up everything
for love. I suppose I ought to have felt touched. But
I really felt sort of mad with her at first. Afterward,
thinking it over, I decided it was not so foolish, and
now I&#8217;ve veered round so far that I&#8217;m inclined to encourage
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On general principles you think domesticity is better
for a woman than the glare of the footlights?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that way. I think a gift like Mariposa
Moreau&#8217;s should be cultivated and given to the public.
I never had any sympathy with that man in the Bible
who buried his talent in the ground. I think talents
were made to be used. What I thought, was, why
shouldn&#8217;t Mariposa marry the man she cared for and
go with him to Paris. It would be a much better arrangement
all round. She isn&#8217;t very smart or capable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
and she&#8217;s young and childish for her years. Don&#8217;t
you think she is, Mr. Essex?&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex again raised his eyebrows and looked into
the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said in a dubious tone. &#8220;Yes, I suppose
she is. She is certainly not a sophisticated or worldly
person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. She&#8217;s green&mdash;green about everything.
Some way or other I didn&#8217;t like the thought
of sending her off there by herself, where she didn&#8217;t
know a soul. And then she&#8217;s so handsome. If she
was ugly it wouldn&#8217;t matter so much. But she&#8217;s very
good-looking, and when you add that to her being so
inexperienced and green about everything you begin
to realize the responsibility of sending her alone to
a strange country, especially Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paris is not a city,&#8221; commented her companion,
&#8220;where young, beautiful and unprotected females are
objects of public protection and solicitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the reason why I want, now, to encourage
this marriage. With a husband that she loves to take
care of her, everything would be smooth sailing.
She&#8217;d be happy and not homesick or strange. He&#8217;d
be there with her, to watch over her and probably
help her with her studies. Perhaps he could
get some position, just to occupy his time. Because,
so far as money went, I&#8217;d see to it that they were
well provided for during the time she was preparing.
Lepine said that he thought two or three years would
be sufficient for her to study. Well, I&#8217;d give them
fifteen thousand dollars to start on. And if that wasn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
enough, or she was not ready to appear at the expected
time, there would be more. There&#8217;d be no question
about means of living, anyway. They could just put
that out of their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always heard that Mrs. Shackleton was generous,&#8221;
said Essex, looking at her with a slight smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, generous!&#8221; she said, with a little movement of
impatience, which was genuine. &#8220;This is no question
of generosity; I want the girl to go and be a singer,
and I don&#8217;t want her to go alone. Now, I&#8217;ve found out
a way for her to go that will be agreeable to her and
to me, and, I take for granted, to the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at Essex with a smile that almost said
she knew him to be that favored person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;it would be better for
him to get some work. It&#8217;s bad for man or woman to
be idle. If he knows how to write, it would be an
easy matter to make him Paris correspondent of <i>The
Trumpet</i>. It was my husband&#8217;s intention to have a
correspondent, and he had some idea of offering it to
Mrs. Willers. But it&#8217;s not the work for her, nor she
the woman for it. It ought to be a man, and a man
that&#8217;s conversant with the country and the language.
There&#8217;ll be a good salary to go with it. Win was talking
about it only the other evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a showering of good fortune on one person,&#8221;
said Essex&mdash;&#8220;a position ready-made, a small fortune
and a beautiful wife! He must be a favorite of the
gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can call it what you like, Mr. Essex,&#8221; said
Bessie. &#8220;It&#8217;s been my experience that the gods take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
for their favorites men and women who&#8217;ve got some
hustle. Everybody has a chance some time or other.
Miss Moreau and her young man have theirs now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, for at that moment, Pussy
Thurston appeared in the doorway to say good night.</p>

<p>The pretty creature had cast more than one covertly
admiring look at Essex, during the dinner, and now,
as she held out her hand to him in farewell, she said
after the informal Western fashion:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come to see me, Mr. Essex? I&#8217;m always
at home on Sunday afternoon. If you&#8217;re bashful,
Win will bring you. He comes sometimes when
he&#8217;s got nowhere else in the world to go to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Win, who was just behind her, expressed his willingness
to act as escort, and laughing and jesting, the
party passed through the doorway into the drawing-room.
The little fires were burning low. By the light
of one, Maud and Count de Lamolle were looking at a
book of photographs of Swiss views. The count&#8217;s
expression was enigmatic, and as Bessie approached
them she heard Maud say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a mountain. What&#8217;s the name of it,
now? I can&#8217;t remember. It&#8217;s very high and pointed,
and people are always climbing it and falling into
holes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Matterhorn, perhaps,&#8221; suggested the count,
politely.</p>

<p>To which Maud gave a relieved assent. Her words
were commonplace enough, but there was a quality
of light-heartedness, of suppressed elation, in her voice,
that her mother&#8217;s quick ear instantly caught. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
girl looked up at their approaching figures her face
showed the same newly-acquired sparkle that was almost
joyous.</p>

<p>It had, in fact, been a critical evening for Maud, and
so miserable did she feel her situation to be, that she
had taken her courage in both hands and struck one
desperate blow for freedom.</p>

<p>When her mother and Essex had begun their pictorial
migrations she had felt the cold dread of a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
with the count creeping over her heart. For a
space she had tried to remain attached to Win and
Pussy Thornton, but neither Win nor Pussy, who were
old friends and had many subjects of mutual interest
to discuss, encouraged her society. Maud was not the
person to develop diplomatic genius under the most
favorable circumstances. Half an hour after the men
had entered the drawing-room, she found herself alone
with the count, in front of the fire, Win and Pussy
having strayed away to the Bouguereau.</p>

<p>The count had tried various subjects of conversation,
but they had drooped and died after a few minutes
of languishing existence. He stood with his back
to the mantelpiece, looking curiously at Maud, who
sat on the edge of an armchair just within reach of
the fluctuating light. Her hands were clasped on her
knee and she was looking down so that he could not
see her face.</p>

<p>Suddenly she rose to her feet and faced him. She
was pale and her eyes looked miserable and terrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Count de Lamolle,&#8221; she breathed in a tremulous
voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; he said, moving toward her, very
much surprised by her appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to say something to you. It may sound
queer, but I&#8217;ve got to say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Miss,&#8221; said the Frenchman, really concerned
by her tragic demeanor, &#8220;say whatever pleases you.
I am only here to listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really care for me. Oh, if you&#8217;d only tell
the truth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a strange remark,&#8221; he said, completely taken
by surprise, and wondering what this extraordinary
girl was going to say next.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought you really cared it would be different.
Perhaps I couldn&#8217;t say it. I hate making people miserable,
and yet so many people make me miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who makes you miserable, dear young lady?&#8221; he
said, honestly touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You,&#8221; she almost whispered. &#8220;You do. You don&#8217;t
mean to, I know, for I think you&#8217;re kinder than lots
of other men. But&mdash;but&mdash; Oh please, don&#8217;t keep on
asking me to marry you. Don&#8217;t do it any more; that
makes me miserable. Because I can&#8217;t do it. Truly, I
can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count de Lamolle became very grave. He drew
himself up with an odd, stiff air, like a soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;If a lady speaks this way to a man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
man can only obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maud hung on his words. When she grasped their
import, she suddenly moved toward him. There was
something pathetic in her eagerness of gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks! thanks! I knew you&#8217;d do it. It&#8217;s not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
you I object to. I like you better than any of the
others. But&#8221;&mdash;she glanced over her shoulder into the
lantern-lit brilliance of the Moorish room and dropped
her voice&mdash;&#8220;there&#8217;s some one I like more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the count, and his dark eyes turned from
her face, which had become very red.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to marry me some day. He&#8217;s just Jack
Latimer, the stenographer in the office. But I like
him, and that&#8217;s all there is to it. But mommer&#8217;s terribly
set on you. And she&#8217;s so determined. Oh, Count
de Lamolle, it&#8217;s very hard to make determined people
see things differently to what they want. So please,
don&#8217;t want to marry me any more, for if you don&#8217;t
want to, that will have to end it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped, her lips trembling. The count took
her hand, cold and clammy, and lifting it pressed his
lips lightly on the back. Then, dropping it, he said,
quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;All is understood. You have honored me highly,
Mademoiselle, by giving me your confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood silent for a moment. The kiss on her
hand, the something friendly and kind&mdash;so different
from the cold looks of unadmiring criticism she was
accustomed to&mdash;in the man&#8217;s eyes brought her uncomfortably
close to tears. Few people had been kind to
Maud Shackleton in the midst of her riches and splendor.</p>

<p>The count saw her emotion and turned toward the
fire. He felt more drawn to her than he had ever
been during his courtship. From the tail of his eye he
saw her little handkerchief whisk out and then into
her pocket. As it disappeared he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>&#8220;I see, Miss Shackleton, that you have some albums
of views on the table. Might we not look at them together?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus it was that Bessie and Essex found them.
They had worked through two volumes of Northern
Italy, and were in Switzerland. And over the stiffened
pages with their photographs, not one-half of which
Maud could remember though she had been to all the
places on her trip abroad, they had come nearer being
friends than ever before.</p>

<small>THE WOMAN TALKS</small></h3>
</div>


<p class="quote">&#8220;My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
burned; then I spake with my tongue.&#8221;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalms.</span></p>



<p>The morning after her interview with Essex Mariposa
had appeared at breakfast white-cheeked and apathetic.
She had eaten nothing, and when questioned
as to her state of health had replied that she had
passed a sleepless night and had a headache. Mrs.
Garcia, the younger, in a dingy cotton wrapper belted
by a white apron, shook her head over the coffee-pot
and began to tell how the late Juan Garcia had been
the victim of headaches due to green wall-paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia, looking up from under the
lambrequin of blond curls that adorned her brow,
&#8220;there&#8217;s nothing green in your wall-paper. It&#8217;s white,
with gold wheat-ears on it. So I don&#8217;t see what gives
you headaches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Headaches <i>do</i> come from other things besides green
wall-paper,&#8221; said Pierpont; &#8220;I&#8217;ve had them from overwork.
I&#8217;d advise Miss Moreau to give her pupils a
week&#8217;s holiday. And then she can come down some
afternoon and sing for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was an old subject of discourse at the Garcia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
table, Mariposa continually refusing the young man&#8217;s
invitations to let him hear and pass judgment upon her
voice. Since he had met her he had heard further details
of the recital at the opera-house and the opinion
of Lepine, and was openly ambitious to have Mariposa
for a pupil. Now she looked up at him with a sudden
spark of animation in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will some day. I&#8217;ll come in some afternoon and
sing for you&mdash;some afternoon when I have no headache,&#8221;
she added hastily, seeing the prospect of urging
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Barron, sitting opposite, had been watching her
covertly through the meal. He saw that she ate nothing,
and guessed that the headache she pleaded was the
result of a wakeful night. The evening before, when
he had gone in to see the little boys in bed, he had casually
asked them if they had been playing games that
afternoon in which shouting had been a prominent
feature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indians?&#8221; Benito had suggested, sitting up in his
cot and scratching the back of his neck; &#8220;that&#8217;s a hollering
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any game with screams. When I came in I
thought I heard shouts coming from somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t us,&#8221; said Miguel from his larger bed
in the corner. &#8220;We was playing burying soldiers in
the back yard, and that&#8217;s a game where you bury soldiers,
cut out of the papers, in the sandy place. There&#8217;s
no sorter hollering in it. Sometimes we play we&#8217;re
crying, but that&#8217;s quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;raps,&#8221; said Benito sleepily, &#8220;it was Miss Moreau&#8217;s
gentleman in the parlor. I let him in. They might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
have been singing. Now tell us the story about the
Indians and the pony express.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all the satisfaction he got from the boys.
After the story was told he did not go downstairs, but
went into his own room and sat by his littered table,
thinking. The details of his entrance into the house
a few hours before were engraved on his mind&#8217;s eye.
By the uncertain gaslight he saw the dark face of the
stranger, with its slightly insolent droop of eyelid and
non-committal line of clean-shaven lip. It was to his
idea a disagreeable face. The simple man in him read
through its shield of reserve to the complexities beneath.
The healthily frank American saw in it the
intricate sophistication of older civilizations, of vast
communities where &#8220;God hath made man upright; but
they have sought out many inventions.&#8221;</p>

<p>On his ear again fell the cold politeness of the voice.
Gamaliel Barron was too lacking in any form of self-consciousness,
was too indifferently confident of himself
as a Westerner, the equal of any and all human
creatures, to experience that sensation of <i>mauvaise
honte</i> that men of smaller fiber are apt to feel in the
presence of beings of superior polish. Polish was
nothing to him. The man everything. And it seemed
to him he had seen the man, deep down, in that one
startled moment of encounter in the hall. Thoughtfully
smoking and tilting back in his chair, he mentally
summed him up in the two words, &#8220;bad egg.&#8221; He
would keep his eye on him, and to do so would put off
the trip to the mines he was to take in the course of
the next two weeks.</p>

<p>The next morning Mariposa&#8217;s appearance at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
breakfast table roused the uneasiness he felt to poignant
anxiety. With the keenness of growing love, he realized
that it was the mind that was disturbed more than
the body. He came home to lunch&mdash;an unusual deviation,
as he almost invariably lunched down town at the
Lick House&mdash;and found her at the table as pale and
distrait as ever. After the meal was over he followed
her into the hall. She was slowly ascending the
stairs, one hand on the balustrade, her long, black
dress sliding upward from stair to stair.</p>

<p>He followed her noiselessly, and at the top of the
flight, turning to go to her room, she saw him and
paused, her hand still touching the rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Moreau,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re tired out&mdash;too tired
to teach. Let me go and put off your pupils. I&#8217;ve a
lot of spare time this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How kind of you,&#8221; she said, looking faintly surprised;
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any this afternoon, luckily. I don&#8217;t
work every day; that&#8217;s the point I&#8217;m trying to work up
to; that&#8217;s my highest ambition.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked down at his upturned face and gave a
slight smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Is</i> it overwork that kept you awake last night and
makes you look so pale to-day?&#8221; he queried in a lowered
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;&mdash;she turned away her face
rather impatiently,&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m worried, I suppose. Everybody
has to be worried, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to have you worried. There isn&#8217;t one
wild, crazy thing in the world I wouldn&#8217;t do to prevent
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking up at her with his soul in his eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>
Barron was not the man to hide or juggle with his
love. It possessed him now and shone on his face.
Mariposa&#8217;s eyes turned from it as from the scrutiny of
something at once painful and holy. He laid his hand
on hers on the rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that,&#8221; he said, his deep voice shaken.</p>

<p>Her eyes dropped to the hands and she mechanically
noticed how white her fingers looked between his large,
brown ones. She drew them softly away, feeling his
glance keen, impassioned and unwavering on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s troubling you,&#8221; he continued in the
same voice. &#8220;Why won&#8217;t you let me help you? You
needn&#8217;t tell me what it is, but you might let me help
you. What am I here for but to take care of you, and
fight for you, and protect you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were indescribably sweet to the lonely
girl. All the previous night she had tossed on her
pillow haunted by terror of Essex and what he intended
to do. She had felt herself completely helpless, and
her uncertainty at what step he meant to take was torturing.
For one moment of weakness she thought of
pouring it all out to the man beside her, whose strong
hand on her own had seemed symbolic of the grip, firm
and fearless, he could take on the situation that was
threatening her. Then she realized the impossibility
of such a thing and drew back from the railing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t help me,&#8221; she said; &#8220;no one can.&#8221;</p>

<p>He mounted a step and stretched his hand over the
railing to try to detain her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can do one thing: I can always be here, here
close to you, ready to come when you call me, either in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
trouble or for advice. If ever you want help, help of
any kind, I&#8217;ll be here. And if you had need of me I
think I&#8217;d know it, and no matter where I was, I&#8217;d come.
Remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had half turned away toward her door as he
spoke, and now stood in profile, a tall figure, with her
throat and wrists looking white as milk against the
hard black line of her dress. She seemed a picture
painted in few colors, her hair a coppery bronze, and
her lips a clear, pale red, being the brightest tones in
the composition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you remember?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you want help come to me, or call for me,
and if I were at the ends of the world I&#8217;d hear you and
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned completely away without answering and,
opening her door, vanished into her room.</p>

<p>For the next three or four days she looked much the
same. Mrs. Garcia, junior, talked about the green
wall-paper, and Mrs. Garcia, senior, cooked her Mexican
dainties, which were so hot with chilli peppers that
only a seasoned throat could swallow them. Mariposa
tried to eat and to talk, but both efforts were failures.
She was secretly distracted by apprehensions of Essex&#8217;s
next move. She thought of his face as he had raised
his hand to his smitten cheek, and shuddered at the
memory. She lived in daily dread of his reappearance.
The interview had shattered her nerves, never fully
restored from the series of miserable events that had
preceded and followed her mother&#8217;s death. When she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>
heard the bell ring her heart sprang from her breast
to her throat, and a desire to fly and hide from her
persecutor seized her and held her quivering and alert.</p>

<p>Barron&#8217;s anxiety about her, though not again openly
expressed, continued. He was certain that some blow
to her peace of mind had been delivered by the man
he had seen in the hall. He did not like to question
her, or attempt an intrusion into her confidence, but
he remembered the few words she had dropped that
evening. The man&#8217;s name was Essex, and he was a
friend of Mrs. Willers&#8217;. Barron had known Mrs. Willers
for years. He had been a guest in the house during
the period of her tenancy, and though he did not
see her frequently, had retained an agreeable memory
of her and her daughter.</p>

<p>It was therefore with great relief that, a few
days after his meeting with Essex, he encountered her
in the heart of a gray afternoon crossing Union Square
Plaza.</p>

<p>Mrs. Willers was hastening down to <i>The Trumpet</i>
office after a morning&#8217;s work in her own rooms. Her
rouge had been applied with the usual haste, and she
was conscious that three buttons on one of her boots
were hardly sufficient to retain that necessary article
in place. But she felt brisk and light-hearted, confident
that the article in her hand was smart and spicy
and would lend brightness to her column in <i>The
Trumpet</i>.</p>

<p>She greeted Barron with a friendly hail, and they
paused for a moment&#8217;s chat in the middle of the plaza.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking fresh as a summer morning,&#8221; said
the mining man, whose life, spent searching for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
mineral secrets of the Sierra, had not made him conversant
with those of complexions like Mrs. Willers&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, get out!&#8221; said she, greatly pleased; &#8220;I&#8217;m too old
for that sort of taffy. It&#8217;s almost Edna&#8217;s turn now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be afraid to see Edna soon. She&#8217;s going to be
such a beauty that the only safety&#8217;s in flight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother was even more pleased at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; she said, nodding at him with a
grave eye; &#8220;Edna&#8217;s a beauty. Where she gets it from
is what stumps me. My glass tells me it&#8217;s not from her
mommer, and my memory tells me it&#8217;s not from her
popper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a man on your paper called Essex,&#8221; said
Barron, who was not one to beat about the bush; &#8220;what
sort of a fellow is he, Mrs. Willers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bad sort, I&#8217;m inclined to think. Why do you
ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was at the house the other afternoon, calling on
Miss Moreau. I met him in the hall. I didn&#8217;t cotton
to him at all. She told me he was a friend of yours
and a writer on <i>The Trumpet</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly, hardly liking to go
farther till she gave him some encouragement. He
noticed that her expression had changed and that she
was eying him with a hard, considering attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you like his looks?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen men like that before&mdash;at the mines.
Good-looking chaps, who are sort of imitation gentlemen,
and try to make you take the imitation for the
real thing by putting on dog. I didn&#8217;t like his style,
anyhow, and I don&#8217;t think she does, either.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re right about that,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers; &#8220;do
you know what he was there for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something about music lessons, she said. I didn&#8217;t
like to ask her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Music lessons!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Willers, with a
strong inflection of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Barron, uneasy at her tone and the
strange look of almost agitated astonishment on her
face; &#8220;and I&#8217;m under the impression he said something
to her that frightened her. As I was coming up
the steps that afternoon I heard distinctly some one call
out in the drawing-room. I burst in on the full jump,
for I was certain it was a woman&#8217;s voice, and that
man came out of the drawing-room as I opened the
door. He was smooth as a summer sea; said he hadn&#8217;t
heard a sound, and went out smirking. Then I went
into the drawing-room to see who had been in there
and found Miss Moreau, leaning against the wall and
white as my cuffs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked frowningly at Mrs. Willers. She had
listened without moving, her face rigidly attentive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mariposa didn&#8217;t tell you what they&#8217;d been talking
about?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she told me nothing. And when I asked her
about the screams she said I&#8217;d been mistaken. But I
hadn&#8217;t, Mrs. Willers. That man had scared her some
way, and she&#8217;d screamed. She called for Benito and
Mrs. Garcia. I heard her. And she&#8217;s looked pale and
miserable ever since. What does that blackguard come
to see her for, anyway? What&#8217;s he after?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers, solemnly; &#8220;he wants to
marry her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>&#8220;Wants to marry her! That foreign spider! Well,
he&#8217;s got a gall. Humph!&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Words of sufficient scorn seemed to fail him. That
he should be similarly aspiring did not at that moment
strike him as reason for moderation in his censure of a
rival.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is he trying to scare her into marrying him?
I wish I&#8217;d known that. I&#8217;d have broken his neck in
the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go round breaking people&#8217;s necks,&#8221; said
Mrs. Willers, &#8220;but I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re in that house. If
Barry Essex is going to try to make her marry him by
bullying and bulldozing her, I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s a man
there to keep him in his place. That&#8217;s no way to win
a woman, Mr. Barron. I know, for that&#8217;s the way Willers
courted me. Wouldn&#8217;t hear of my saying no; said
he&#8217;d shoot himself. I knew even then he wouldn&#8217;t, but
I didn&#8217;t know but what he&#8217;d try to wound himself
somewhere where it didn&#8217;t hurt, leaving a letter for
me that would be published in the morning paper. So
I married him to get rid of him, and then I had to get
the law in to get rid of him a second time. A man
that badgers a woman into marrying him is no good.
You can bank on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Barron, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve told me this.
I&#8217;ll keep my eye on Mr. Essex. I was going to the
mines next week, but guess I&#8217;ll put it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do. But don&#8217;t you let on to Mariposa what I&#8217;ve
told you. She wouldn&#8217;t like it. She&#8217;s a proud girl.
But I&#8217;ll tell you, Mr. Barron, she&#8217;s a good one, too;
one of the best kind, and I love her nearly as much
as my own girl. But look!&#8221; glancing at an adjacent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>
clock with a start, &#8220;I must be traveling. This stuff&#8217;s
got to go in at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good by,&#8221; said Barron, holding out his hand; &#8220;it&#8217;s
a good thing we had this minute of talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good by,&#8221; she answered, returning the pressure
with a grip almost as manly; &#8220;it&#8217;s been awfully good to
see you again. I must get a move on. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they parted, Barron turning his face toward the
Garcia house, where he had an engagement to take the
boys to the beach at the foot of Hyde Street, and Mrs.
Willers to <i>The Trumpet</i> office.</p>

<p>Her walk did not occupy more than fifteen minutes,
and during that time the anger roused by the mining
man&#8217;s words grew apace. From smothered indignation
it passed to a state of simmering passion. Her
conscience heated it still further, for it was she who
had introduced Essex to Mariposa, and in the first
stages of their acquaintance had in a careless way encouraged
the friendship, thinking it would be cheerful
for the solitary girl to have the occasional companionship
of this clever and interesting man of the world.
She had thoughtlessly kindled a fire that might burn
far past her power of control and lead to irreparable
disaster.</p>

<p>She inferred from Barron&#8217;s story that Essex was
evidently attempting to frighten Mariposa into smiling
on his suit. The cowardice of the action enraged her,
for, though Mrs. Willers had known many men of
many faults, she had counted no cowards among her
friends. Her point of view was Western. A man
might do many things that offend Eastern conventions
and retain her consideration. But, as she expressed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
to herself in the walk down Third Street, &#8220;He&#8217;s got
to know that in this country they don&#8217;t drag women
shrieking to the altar.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran up the stairs of <i>The Trumpet</i> building with
the lightness of a girl of sixteen. Ire gave wings to
her feet, and it was ire as much as the speed of her ascent
that made her catch her breath quickly at the top
of the fourth flight. Still, even then, she might have
held her indignation in check,&mdash;years of training in
expedient self-control being a powerful force in the
energetic business woman,&mdash;had she not caught a
glimpse of Essex in his den as she passed the open
door.</p>

<p>He was sitting at his desk, leaning languidly back in
his chair, evidently thinking. His face, turned toward
her, looked worn and hard, the lids drooping
with their air of faintly bored insolence. Hearing the
rustle of her dress, he looked up and saw her making
a momentary pause by the doorway. He did not look
pleased at the sight of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mrs. Willers,&#8221; he said, leaning forward to pick
up his pen and speaking with the crisp clearness of
utterance certain people employ when irritated, &#8220;what
is it that you want to see me about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Mrs. Willers abruptly and with battle
in her tone; &#8220;why should I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not the least idea,&#8221; he answered, looking at
his pen, and then, dipping it in the ink, &#8220;unless perhaps
you want a few hints for your forthcoming article,
&#8216;The Kind of Shoestrings Worn by the Crowned
Heads of Europe.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex was out of temper himself. When Mrs. Willers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
interrupted him he had been thinking over the
situation with Mariposa, and it had seemed to him
very cheerless. His remark was well calculated to
enrage the leading spirit of the woman&#8217;s page, who was
as proud of her weekly contributions as though they
had been inspired by the genius of George Eliot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, and her rouge became quite unnecessary
in the flood of natural color that rose to her
face, &#8220;if I was going to tackle that subject I think
you&#8217;d be about the best person to come to for information.
For if you ever have had anything to do with
crowned heads it&#8217;s been as their bootblack.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex was startled by the stinging malice revealed
in this remark. He swung round on his swivel chair
and sat facing his antagonist, making no attempt to
rise, although she entered the room. As he saw her
face in the light of the window he realized that, for
the first time, he saw the woman stirred out of her
carefully acquired professional calm.</p>

<p>As she entered she pushed the door to behind her,
and, taking the chair beside the desk, sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Essex,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I want a word with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any number,&#8221; he answered with ironical politeness.
&#8220;Do you wish the history of my connection with the
crowned heads as court bootblack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to know what business
you&#8217;ve got to go to Mrs. Garcia&#8217;s boarding-house and
frighten one of the ladies living there?&#8221;</p>

<p>An instantaneous change passed over Essex&#8217;s face.
His eyes seemed suddenly to grow veiled as they narrowed
to a cold, non-committal slit. His mouth hardened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>
Mrs. Willers saw the muscles of his cheeks
tighten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this sudden interest in me is quite
flattering. I hardly know what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke to gain time, for he was amazed and enraged.
Mariposa had evidently made a confidante of
Mrs. Willers, and he knew that Mrs. Willers was high
in favor with Winslow Shackleton and his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this country, Mr. Essex,&#8221; Mrs. Willers went on,
clenching her hands in her lap, for they trembled with
her indignation, &#8220;men don&#8217;t scare and browbeat young
women who don&#8217;t happen to have the good taste to
favor them. When a man gets the mitten he knows
enough to get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very clever of him, no doubt,&#8221; he murmured with
unshaken suavity.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to live here you&#8217;ve got to live by
our laws. You&#8217;ve got to do as the Romans do. And
take my word for it, young man, the Romans don&#8217;t
approve of nagging and scaring a woman into marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he answered with a blandly questioning inflection,
&#8220;these are interesting facts in local manners
and customs. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d be of value to some one
who was making a special study of the subject. Personally
I am not deeply interested in the California
aborigines. Even the original and charming specimen
now before me would oblige me greatly by withdrawing.
It is now&#8221;&mdash;looking at the clock that stood on
the side of the desk&mdash;&#8220;half-past two, and my time is
valuable, my dear Mrs. Willers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>Mrs. Willers rose to her feet, burning with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put me off any way you like,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and be as
fresh and smart as you know how. But I tell you,
young man, this has got to stop. That girl&#8217;s got no
one belonging to her here. But don&#8217;t imagine from
that you can have the field to yourself and go on persecuting
her. No&mdash;this is not France nor Spain, nor
any other old monarchy, where a woman didn&#8217;t have
any more to say about herself than a mule, or a pet
parrot. No, sir. You&#8217;ve run up against the wrong
proposition if you think you can scare a woman into
marrying you in California in the nineteenth century.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex rose from his chair. He was pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said in a low voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough
of this. By what right, I&#8217;d like to know, do you dare
to dictate to me or interfere in my acquaintance with
another lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d dare more than that, Barry Essex,&#8221; said Mrs.
Willers, with her rouge standing out red on her white
face, &#8220;to save that girl from a man like you. I don&#8217;t
know what I wouldn&#8217;t dare. But I&#8217;m a good fighter
when my blood&#8217;s up, and I&#8217;ll fight you on this point
till one or the other of us drops.&#8221;</p>

<p>She saw Essex&#8217;s nostrils fan softly in and out. His
cheek-bones looked prominent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly leave this room?&#8221; he said in a suppressed
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I&#8217;m going now. But understand
that I&#8217;m making no idle threats. And if this
persecution goes on I&#8217;ll tell Winslow Shackleton of
the way you&#8217;re acting to a friend of his and a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e
of his mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>She was at the door and had the handle in her hand.
Essex turned on her a face of livid malignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mrs. Willers,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I had no idea you
were entitled to speak for Winslow Shackleton. I
congratulate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment of blind rage Mrs. Willers neither
spoke nor moved. Then she felt the door-handle turn
under her hand and the door push inward. She mechanically
stepped to one side, as it opened, and the
office boy intruded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knocked here twict, and y&#8217;aint answered,&#8221; he
said apologetically. &#8220;There&#8217;s a man to see you, Mr.
Essex, what says he&#8217;s got something to say about a
new kind of balloon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him in,&#8221; said Essex, &#8220;and&mdash;oh&mdash;ah&mdash;Jack,
show Mrs. Willers out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jack gaped at this curious order. Mrs. Willers
brushed past him and walked up the hall to her own
cubby-hole. She was compassed in a lurid mist of
fury, and through this she felt dimly that she had done
no good.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did getting into a rage ever do any good?&#8221; she
thought desperately, as she sank into her desk chair.</p>

<p>Her article lay unnoticed and forgotten by her
side, while she sat staring at her scattered papers, trying
to decide through the storm that still shook her
whether she had not done well in throwing down her
gage in defense of her friend.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of Edna Willers&#8217; music lesson.
Over a week had elapsed since Mariposa&#8217;s interview
with Essex, yet to-day, as she stood at her window
looking out at the threatening sky, her fears of him
were as active as ever. Though he had made no further
sign, her woman&#8217;s intuitions warned her that this
was but a temporary lull in his campaign. She was
living under an exhausting tension. She went out
with the fear of meeting him driving her into unfrequented
side streets, and returned, her eyes straining
through the foliage of the pepper-tree to watch for a
light in the parlor windows.</p>

<p>This afternoon, standing at the window drumming
on the pane with her finger-tips, she looked at the
dun, low-hanging clouds, and thought with shrinking
of her walk to Sutter Street, at any turn of which she
might meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and if I do?&#8221; she said to herself, trying to
whip up her dwindling courage, &#8220;he can&#8217;t do any more
than threaten me with telling all he knows. He can&#8217;t
make a scene on the street proposing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt somewhat cheered by these assurances and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
began putting on her outdoor things. The day was
darkening curiously early, she thought, for, though it
was not yet four, the long mirror, with its top-heavy
gold ornaments, gave back but a dim reflection of her.
There had been fine weather for two weeks, and now
rain was coming. She put on her long cloak, the enveloping
&#8220;circular&#8221; of the mode which fastened at the
throat with a metal clasp, and took her umbrella, a
black cotton one, which seemed to her quite elegant
enough for a humble teacher of music. A small black
bonnet, trimmed with loops of ribbon, crowned her
head and showed her rich hair, rippling loosely back
from her forehead.</p>

<p>The air on the outside was warm and at the same
time was softly and stilly humid. There was not a
breath of wind, and in this motionless, tepid atmosphere
the gardens exhaled moist earth-odors as if
breathing out their strength in panting expectation of
the rain. From the high places of the city one could
see the bay, flat and oily, with its surrounding hills
and its circular sweep of houses, a picture in shaded
grays. The smoke, trailing lazily upward, was the
palest tint in this study in monochrome, while the pall
of the sky, leaden and lowering, was the darkest. A
faint light diffused itself from the rim of sky, visible
round the edges of the pall, and cast an unearthly
yellowish gleam on people&#8217;s faces.</p>

<p>Mariposa walked rapidly downward from street to
street. She kept a furtive lookout for the well-known
figure in its long overcoat and high hat, but saw no
one, and her troubled heart-beats began to moderate.
The damp air on her face refreshed her. She had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
keeping in the house too much of late, and did not
realize that this was still further irritating her already
jangled nerves. The angle of the building in
which Mrs. Willers housed herself broke on her view
just as the first sullen drops of rain began to spot the
pavement&mdash;slow, reluctant drops, falling far apart.</p>

<p>The music lesson had hardly begun when the rain
was lashing the window and pouring down the panes
in fury. Darkness fell with it. The night seemed to
drop on the city in an instant, coming with a whirling
rush of wind and falling waters. The housewifely
little Edna drew the curtains and lit the gas, saying
as she settled back on her music-stool:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stay to dinner with me, Mariposa.
Mommer won&#8217;t be home till late because it&#8217;s Wednesday
and the back part of the woman&#8217;s page goes to
press.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t stay to-night,&#8221; said Mariposa hurriedly,
affrighted by the thought of the walk home
alone at ten o&#8217;clock, which she had often before taken
without a tremor; &#8220;I must go quite soon. I forgot it
was the day when the back sheet goes to press. Go on,
Edna, it will be like the middle of the night by the
time we finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was indeed the case. When the lesson was
over, the evening outside was shrouded in a midnight
darkness to an accompaniment of roaring rain. It was
a torrential downpour. The two girls, peering out
into the street, could see by the blurred rays of the
lamps a swimming highway, down which a car dashed
at intervals, spattering the blackness with the broken
lights of its windows. Despite the child&#8217;s urgings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
to remain, Mariposa insisted on going. She was well
prepared for wet she said, folding her circular about
her and removing the elastic band that held together
her disreputable umbrella.</p>

<p>But she did not realize the force of the storm till
she found herself in the street. By keeping in the lee
of the houses on the right-hand side, she could escape
the full fury of the wind, and she began slowly making
her way upward.</p>

<p>She had gone some distance when the roll of music
she carried slipped from under her arm and fell into
water and darkness. She groped for it, clutched its
saturated cover, and brought it up dripping. The
music was of value to her, and she moved forward to
where the light of an uncurtained window cut the
darkness, revealing the top of a wall. Here she
rested the roll and tried to wipe it dry with her handkerchief.
Her face, down-bent and earnest, was distinctly
visible in the shaft of light. A man, standing
opposite, who had been patrolling these streets for the
past hour, saw it, gave a smothered exclamation, and
crossed the street. He was at her side before she saw
him.</p>

<p>Several hours earlier Essex had been passing down
a thoroughfare in that neighborhood, when he had met
Benito, slowly wending his way homeward from school.
The child recognized him and smiled, and with the
smile, Essex recollected the face and saw that fate was
still on his side.</p>

<p>Pressing a quarter into Benito&#8217;s readily extended
palm, he had inquired if the boy knew where Miss
Moreau was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>&#8220;Mariposa?&#8221; said Benito, with easy familiarity;
&#8220;she&#8217;s at Mrs. Willers&#8217; giving Edna her lesson. This
is Wednesday, ain&#8217;t it? Well, Edna gets her lesson on
Wednesday from half-past four till half-past five, and
so that&#8217;s where Mariposa is. But she&#8217;s generally late
&#8217;cause she stays and talks to Mrs. Willers.&#8221;</p>

<p>At five o&#8217;clock, sheltered by the dripping dark, Essex
began his furtive watch of the streets along which she
might pass. He knew that every day was precious to
him now, with Mrs. Willers among his enemies and
ready to enlist Winslow Shackleton against him. Here
was an opportunity to see the girl, better than the
parlor of the Garcia house offered, with its officious
boarders. There was absolute seclusion in these black
and rain-swept streets.</p>

<p>He had been prowling about for an hour when he
finally saw her. A dozen times he had cursed under
his breath fearing she had escaped him; now his relief
was such that he ran toward her, and with a rough
hand swept aside her umbrella. In the clear light of
the uncurtained pane she saw his face, and shrank back
against the wall as if she had been struck. Then a second
impulse seized her and she tried to dash past him.
He seemed prepared for this and caught her by the
arm through her cloak, swinging her violently back
to her place against the wall.</p>

<p>Keeping his grip on her he said, trying to smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you afraid of? Don&#8217;t you know me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; she said, struggling, &#8220;you&#8217;re hurting
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hurt you,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
mean to keep you for a moment. I want to talk to
you. And I&#8217;m going to talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t listen to you. Let me go at once. How
cowardly to hold me in this way against my will!&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried again to wrench her arm out of his grasp,
but he held her like a vise. Her resistance of him and
the repugnance in face and voice maddened him. He
felt for a moment that he would like to batter her
against the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use trying to get away, and telling me
how much you hate me. I&#8217;ve got you here at last. I&#8217;ll
not let you go till I&#8217;ve had my say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his face down under the tent of her umbrella
and gazed at her with menacing eyes and tight lips.
In the light of the window and against the inky blackness
around them the two faces were distinct as cameos
hung on a velvet background. He saw the whiteness
of her chin on the bow beneath it, and her mouth, with
the lips that all the anger in the world could not make
hard or unlovely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to listen to me,&#8221; he said, shaking her
arm as if trying to shake some passion into the set
antagonism of her face; &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to be my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>She suddenly seized her umbrella and, turning it
toward him, pressed it down between them. The action
was so quick and unexpected that the man did
not move back, and the ferrule striking him on the
cheek, furrowed a long scratch on the smooth skin. A
drop of blood rose to the surface.</p>

<p>With an oath he seized the umbrella and, tearing it
from her grasp, sent it flying into the street. Here the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
wind snatched it, and its inverted shape, like a large
black mushroom, went sweeping forward, tilted and
already half full of water, before the angry gusts.</p>

<p>Essex tried to keep his own over her, still retaining
his hold on her arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, be reasonable,&#8221; he said; &#8220;there&#8217;s no use
angering me for nothing. This is a wet place for
lovers to have meetings. Give me my answer, and I
swear I&#8217;ll not detain you. When will you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the good of talking that way? You know
perfectly what I&#8217;ll say. It will always be the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that. I&#8217;ve got something to say
that may make you change your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed the umbrella back that the light might
fall directly on her. It fell on him also. She saw his
face under the brim of his soaked hat, shining with
rain, pallidly sinister, the trickle of blood on one cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that you can say will ever make me change
my mind. Mr. Essex, I am wet and tired; won&#8217;t you,
please, let me go?&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to eliminate dislike and fear from her
voice and spoke with a gentleness that she hoped would
soften him. He heard it with a thrill; but it had an
exactly contrary effect to what she had desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like never to let you go. Just to hold you
here and look at you. Mariposa, you don&#8217;t know what
this love is I have for you. It grows with absence, and
then when I see you it grows again with the sight of
you. It&#8217;s eating into me like a poison. I can&#8217;t get
away from it. You loved me once, why have you
changed? What has come over you to take all that
out of you? Is it because I made a foolish mistake?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
I&#8217;m ready to do anything you suggest&mdash;crawl in the
dust, kneel now in the rain, and ask you to forgive it.
Don&#8217;t be hard and revengeful. It&#8217;s not like you. Be
kind, be merciful to a man who, if he said what hurt
you, has repented it with all his soul ever since. I
am ready to give you my whole life to make amends.
Say you forgive me. Say you love me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was speaking the truth. Passion had outrun
cupidity. Mariposa, poor or rich, had become the end
and aim of his existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a question of forgiveness,&#8221; she answered,
seeing he still persisted in the thought that she was
hiding her love from wounded pride; &#8220;it&#8217;s not a question
of love. I&mdash;I&mdash;don&#8217;t like you. Can&#8217;t you understand
that? I don&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not true&mdash;it&#8217;s not true,&#8221; he vociferated. &#8220;You
love me&mdash;say you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook her by the arm as though to shake the
words out of her reluctant lips. The brutal roughness
of the action spurred her from fear to indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not love. It&#8217;s not even hate. It&#8217;s just repulsion
and dislike. I can&#8217;t bear to look at you, or have
you come near me, and to have you hold me, as you&#8217;re
doing now, is as if some horrible thing, like a spider
or a snake, was crawling on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Amid the rustling and the splashing of the rain they
again looked at each other for a fierce, pallid moment.
Another drop of blood on his cheek detached itself
and ran down. He had no free hand with which to
wipe it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you&#8217;re going to marry me,&#8221; he said softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard enough of this,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>
to stand here talking to a madman. It&#8217;s early yet
and these houses are full of people. If I give one cry
every window will go up. I don&#8217;t want to make a
scene here on the street, but if you detain me any
longer talking in this crazy way, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll have
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait one moment before you take such desperate
measures. I want to ask a question before you
call out the neighborhood to protect you. How do
you think the story of your mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s early
history will look on the front page of <i>The Era</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the light of the window that fell across them both
he had the satisfaction of seeing her face freeze into
horrified amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be the greatest scoop <i>The Era&#8217;s</i> had since
<i>The Trumpet</i> became Shackleton&#8217;s property. There&#8217;s
not a soul here that even suspects it. It will be a bombshell
to the city, involving people of the highest position,
like the Shackletons, and people of the most unquestioned
respectability, like the Moreaus. Oh&mdash;it
will be good reading!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes, fastened on him, were full of anguish, but
it had not bewildered her. In the stress of the moment
her mind remained clear and active.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the world interested in stories of the dead?&#8221; she
heard herself saying in a cold voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s interested in scandals. And what a
scandal it is! How people will smack their lips over
it! Shackleton a Mormon, and you his only legitimate
child. Your mother and father, that all the world honored,
common free-lovers. Your mother sold to your
father for a pair of horses, and living with him in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
cabin in the Sierra for six months before they even
attempted to straighten things out by a bogus marriage
ceremony. Why, it&#8217;s a splendid story! <i>The Era&#8217;s</i> had
nothing with as much ginger as that for months!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who&#8217;d believe you? Who are you, to know
about the early histories of the pioneer families?
Who&#8217;d believe the words of a man who comes from
nobody knows where, whose very name people doubt?
If Mrs. Shackleton and I deny the truth of your story,
who&#8217;d believe you then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that I have under my hand the man
who was witness of the transaction whereby Moreau
bought your mother from Shackleton for a pair of
horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A drunken thief! He stole all my father had and
ran away. Can his word carry the same weight as
mine to whose interest it would be to prove myself
Shackleton&#8217;s daughter? No. The only real proof in
existence is the marriage certificate. And I have that.
And so long as I have that any story you choose to
publish I can get up and deny.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew she was right. Even with Harney his
story would be discredited, unbacked by the one piece
of genuine evidence of the first marriage&mdash;the certificate
which she possessed. Her unexpected recognition
of the point staggered him. He had thought to break
her resistance by threats which even to him seemed
shameful, and only excusable because of the stress he
found himself in. Now he saw her as defiantly unconquered
as ever. In his rage he pushed her back against
the wall, crying at her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Deny, deny all you like! Whether you deny or not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>
the thing will have been said. Next Sunday the whole
city, the whole state will be reading it&mdash;how you&#8217;re
Shackleton&#8217;s daughter and your mother was Dan
Moreau&#8217;s mistress. But say one word&mdash;one little word
to me, and not a syllable will be written, not a whisper
spoken. On one side there&#8217;s happiness and luxury and
love, and on the other disgrace and poverty&mdash;not your
disgrace alone, but your father&#8217;s, your mother&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry of rage and despair Mariposa tried to
tear herself from him. Nature aided her, for at the
same moment a savage gust of wind seized the umbrella
and wrenched it this way and that. Instinctively
he loosened his hold on her to grasp it, and in that one
moment she tore herself away from him. He gripped
at the flapping wing of her cloak, and caught it. But
the strain was too much for the cheap metal clasp,
which broke, and Mariposa slipped out of it and flew
into the fury of the rain, leaving the cloak in his hand.</p>

<p>The roar of many waters and the shouting of the
wind obliterated the sound of her flying feet. The
darkness, shot through with the blurred faces of lamps
or the long rays from an occasional uncurtained pane,
in a moment absorbed her black figure. Essex stood
motionless, stunned at the suddenness of her escape,
the sodden cloak trailing from his hand. Then shaken
out of all reason by rage, not knowing what he intended
doing, he started in pursuit.</p>

<p>She feared this and her burst of bravery was exhausted.
As she ran up the steep street having only
the darkness to hide her, her heart seemed shriveled
with the fear of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>Suddenly she heard the thud of his feet behind her.
An agony of fright seized her. The Garcia house was
at least two blocks farther on, and she knew he would
overtake her before then. A black doorway with a
huddle of little trees, formless and dark now, loomed
close by, and toward this she darted, crouching down
among the small wet trunks of the shrubs and parting
their foliage with shaking hands.</p>

<p>There was a lamp not far off and in its rays she
saw him running up, still holding the cloak in a black
bunch over his arm. He stopped, just beyond where
she cowered, and looked irresolutely up and down.
The lamplight fell on his face, and in certain angles
she saw it plainly, pale and glistening with moisture,
all keen and alert with a look of attentive cunning.
He moved his head this way and that, evidently trusting
more to hearing than to sight. His eyes, no longer
half veiled in cold indifference, swept her hiding-place
with the preoccupation of one who listens intently. He
looked to her like some thwarted animal harkening for
the steps of his prey. Her terror grew with the sight
of him. She thought if he had approached the bushes
she would have swooned before he reached them.</p>

<p>Presently he turned and went down the hill. In the
pause his reason had reasserted itself, and he felt that
to hound her down with more threats and reproaches
was useless folly.</p>

<p>But, with her, reason and judgment were hopelessly
submerged by terror. She crept out from among the
shrubs with white face and trembling limbs, and fled
up the hill in a wild, breathless race, hearing Essex in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
every sound. The rain had dripped on her through
the bushes, and these last two blocks under its unrestrained
fury soaked her to the skin.</p>

<p>Her haunting terror did not leave her till she had
rushed up the stairs and opened the door of the glass
porch. She was fumbling in her pocket for the latch-key,
when the inner door was opened and Barron stood
in the aperture, the lighted hall behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth has delayed you?&#8221; he said sharply.
&#8220;They&#8217;re all at supper. I was just going down to Mrs.
Willers&#8217; to see what was keeping you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stumbled in at the door, and stood in the revealing
light of the hall, for the moment unable to answer,
panting and drenched.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he said suddenly in a different
tone; and quickly stepping back he shut the door
into the dining-room. &#8220;Has anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;only&mdash;only&mdash;frightened,&#8221; she gasped between
broken breaths. &#8220;Something frightened me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She reeled and caught against the door-post.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all wet,&#8221; she whispered with white lips; &#8220;don&#8217;t
let them know. I don&#8217;t want any dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm round her and drew her toward the
stairs. He could feel her trembling like a person with
an ague and her saturated clothes left rillets along the
stairs.</p>

<p>When they were half-way up he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get so wet? Have you been out in
this storm without an umbrella?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost it,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost it?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your cloak?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>&#8220;Somewhere,&#8221; she said vaguely; &#8220;somewhere in the
street. I lost that, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were at the top of the stairs. She suddenly
turned toward him and pressed her face into his shoulder,
trembling like a terrified animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frightened,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell them
downstairs. I&#8217;ll tell you to-morrow. Don&#8217;t ask me
anything to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her into her room and placed her in an armchair
by the fireplace. He lit the gas and drew the
curtains, and then knelt by the hearth to kindle the
fire, saying nothing and apparently taking little notice
of her. She sat dully watching him, her hands in her
lap, the water running off her skirts along the carpet.</p>

<p>When he had lit the fire he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll go, and you take off your things. I&#8217;ll
bring you up your supper in half an hour. Be quick,
you&#8217;re soaking. I&#8217;ll tell them downstairs you&#8217;re too
tired to come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out, softly closing the door. She sat on in
her wet clothes, feeling the growing warmth of the
flames on her face and hands. She seemed to fall into
a lethargy of exhaustion and sat thus motionless, the
water running unheeded on the carpet, <i>frissons</i> of cold
occasionally shaking her, till a knock at the door roused
her. Then she suddenly remembered Barron and his
command to take off her wet clothes. She had them
on still and he would be angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it down on the chair outside,&#8221; she called
through the door; &#8220;I&#8217;m not ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you open the door and take this whisky and
drink it at once?&#8221; came his answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span>She opened the door a crack and, putting her hand
through the aperture, took the glass with the whisky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you warm and dry?&#8221; he said; all she could see
of him was his big hand clasped round the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, quite,&#8221; she answered, though she felt her skin
quivering with cold against the damp garments that
seemed glued to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, drink this now, right off. And listen&mdash;&#8221; as
the door began to close&mdash;&#8220;if you get nervous or anything
just come to your door and call me. I&#8217;ll leave
mine open, and I&#8217;m a very light sleeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then before she could answer she felt the door-handle
pulled from the outside and the door was shut.</p>

<p>She hastily took off her things and put on dry ones,
and then shrugged herself into the thick wrapper of
black and white that had been her mother&#8217;s. Even her
hair was wet, she found out as she undressed, and she
mechanically undid it and shook the damp locks loose
on her shoulders. She felt penetrated with cold, and
still overmastered by fear. Every gust that made the
long limb of the pepper-tree grate against the balcony
roof caused her heart to leap. When she opened the
door to get her supper, the glow of light that fell from
Barron&#8217;s room, across the hallway, came to her with a
hail of friendship and life. She stood listening, and
heard the creak of his rocking-chair, then smelt the
whiff of a cigar. He was close to her. She shut the
door, feeling her terrors allayed.</p>

<p>She picked at her supper, but soon set the tray on
the center-table and took the easy-chair before the fire.
The sense of physical cold was passing off, but the indescribable
oppression and apprehension remained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
She did not know exactly what she dreaded, but she
felt in some vague way that she would be safer sitting
thus clad and wakeful before the fire than sleeping in
her bed. Once or twice, as the hours passed and her
fears strengthened in the silence and mystery of the
night, she crept to her door, and opening it, looked up
the hall. The square of light was still there, the scent
of the cigar pungent on the air. She shut the door
softly, each time feeling soothed as by the pressure of
a strong, loving hand.</p>

<p>Sometime toward the middle of the night the heaviness
of sleep came on her, and though she fought
against it, feeling that the safety she was struggling to
maintain against mysterious menace was only to be
preserved by wakefulness, Nature overcame her.
Curled in her chair before the crumbling fire, she
finally slept&mdash;the deep, motionless sleep of physical
and mental exhaustion.</p>

<p>Under cover of the darkness Essex hurried down the
street toward where the city passed from a place of
homes to a business mart. He had at first no fixed idea
of a goal, but after a few moments&#8217; rapid march, realized
that habit was taking him in the direction of Bertrand&#8217;s.
An illumined clock face shining on him over
the roofs told him it was some time past his dinner
hour. He obeyed his instinct and bent his steps
toward the restaurant, throwing the cloak over the
fence of a vacant lot and wiping the trickle of blood
from his cheek with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>He was cool and master of himself once more. His
brain was cleared, as a sky by storm, and he knew that
to-night&#8217;s interview must be one of the last he would
have with the woman who had come to stand to him
for love, wealth, success and happiness. He must win
or lose all within the next few days.</p>

<p>Bertrand&#8217;s looked invitingly bright after the tempestuous
blackness of the streets. Many of the white
draped tables were unoccupied. His accustomed eye
noted that the lady in the blue silk dress and black hat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>
and her companion with the bald head and cross-eye,
who always sat at the right-hand corner table, were
absent. He had fallen into the habit of bowing to
them, and had more than once idly wondered what
their relations were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur Esseex&#8221; to-night ate little and drank
much. Etienne, the waiter, a black-haired, pink-cheeked
gar&ccedil;on from Marseilles, noticed this and afterward
remarked upon it to Madame Bertrand. To the
few other habitu&eacute;s of the place, the thin-faced, handsome
man with an ugly furrow down his cheek, and his
hair tumbled on his forehead by the pressure of his hat,
presented the same suavely imperturbable demeanor as
usual. But Madame Bertrand, as a woman whose
business it was to observe people and faces, noticed
that monsieur was pale, and that when she spoke to
him on the way in he had given a distrait answer, not
the usual phrase of debonair, Gallic greeting she had
grown to expect.</p>

<p>She looked at him from her cashier&#8217;s desk and reflected.
As Etienne afterward repeated, he ate little
and drank much. And how pale he looked, with the
lamp on the wall above him throwing out the high
lights on his face and deepening the shadows!</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in love,&#8221; thought the sentimental Madame
Bertrand, &#8220;and to-night for the first time he knows
that she does not respond.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat longer than he had ever done before over his
dinner, blowing clouds of cigarette smoke about his
head, and watching the thin blue flame of the burning
lump of sugar in the spoon balanced on his coffee-cup.</p>

<p>Everybody had left, and he still sat smoking, leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
back against the wall, his eyes fixed on space in immovable,
concentrated thought. Bertrand came out of his
corner, and in his cap and apron stood cooling himself
in the open door watching the rain. Etienne and
Henri, the two waiters apportioned to that part of the
room, hung about restless and tired, eagerly watching
for the first symptoms of his departure. Even Madame
Bertrand began to burrow under the cashier&#8217;s desk for
her rubbers, and to struggle into them with much
creaking of corset bones and subdued French ejaculations.
It was after nine when the last guest finally
pushed back his chair. Etienne rushed to help him on
with his coat, and Madame Bertrand bobbed up from
her rubbers to give him a parting smile.</p>

<p>A half-hour later he was lighting the gas in his own
room in Bush Street. The damp air of the night entered
through a crack of opened window, introducing
a breath of sweet, moist freshness into the smoke-saturated
chamber. He threw off his coat and lit the fire.
As soon as it had caught satisfactorily he left the room,
crossed the hall noiselessly, and with a slight preliminary
knock, opened Harney&#8217;s door. The man was sitting
there in a broken rocking-chair, reading the evening
paper by the light of a flaming gas-jet. He had
the air of one who was waiting, and as Essex&#8217;s head
was advanced round the edge of the door, he looked
up with alert, expectant eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into my room,&#8221; said the younger man;
&#8220;there&#8217;s work for you to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Harney threw down his paper and followed him
across the hall. It was evident that he was sober, and
beyond this some new sense of importance and power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
had taken from his manner its old deprecation. They
were equals now, pals and partners. The drunken
typesetter and one-time thief was still under Barry
Essex&#8217;s thumb, but he was also deep in his confidence.</p>

<p>He sat down in his old seat by the fire, his eyes on
Essex.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he said; &#8220;what work have you got
for me such a night as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big work, and with big money behind it,&#8221; said the
younger man; &#8220;and when it&#8217;s done we each get our
share and go our ways, George Harney.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew his chair to the other side of the fire and
began to talk&mdash;his voice low and quiet at first, growing
urgent and authoritative, as Harney shrank before
the dangers of the work expected of him. The
moments ticked by, the fire growing hotter and
brighter, the roaring of the storm sounding above the
voices of the master and his tool. The night was half
spent before Harney was conquered and instructed.</p>

<p>Then the men, waiting for the hour of deepest sleep
and darkness, continued to sit, occasionally speaking,
the light of the leaping flames catching and losing
their anxious faces as the firelight in another room
was touching the face of the sleeping girl of whom
they talked.</p>

<p>It was nearly three when a movement of life stirred
the blackness of the Garcia garden. The rushing of
the rain beat down all sound; in the moist soddenness
of the earth no trace lingered. The pepper-tree bent
and cracked to the gusts as it did to the additional
weight of the creeping figure in its boughs.</p>

<p>This was merely a shapeless bulk of blackness amid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>
the fine and broken blackness of the swaying foliage.
It stole forward with noiseless caution, though it might
have shouted and all sound been lost in the angry
turmoil of the night. Creeping upward along the
great limb that stretched to the balcony roof, a perpendicular
knife-edge of light that gleamed from between
the curtains of a window, now and then crossed
its face, sometimes dividing it clearly in two, sometimes
illuminating one attentive eye, a small shining
point of life in the dead murk around it, one eye,
aglow with purpose, gleaming startlingly from blackness.</p>

<p>The loud drumming of the rain on the balcony roof
drowned the crackle of the tin under a feeling foot.
To slide there from the limb only occupied a moment.
The branch had grown well up over the roof, grating
now and then against it when the wind was high.
The thin streak of light from between the curtains
made the man wary. Why was she burning a light at
this hour unless she was sleepless and up?</p>

<p>Pressed close to the pane he applied his eye to the
crack which was the widest near the sill. He saw a
portion of the room, looking curiously vivid and distinct
in the narrow concentration of his view. It
seemed flooded with unsteady, warmly yellow light.
Straight before him he saw a table with a rifled tea-tray
on it, and back of that another table. The one
eye pressed to the crack grew absorbed as it focused
itself on the second table. Among a litter of books,
ornaments and feminine trifles, stood a small desk of
dark wood. It was as if it had been placed there to
catch his attention&mdash;the goal of his line of vision.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>Shifting his position he pressed his cheek against
the glass and squinted in sidewise to where a deepening
and quivering of the light spoke of a fire. Then
he saw the figure of the sleeping woman, lying in an
attitude of complete repose in the armchair. He gazed
at her striving to gage the depth of her sleep. One
of her hands hung over the arm of the chair, with the
gleam of the fire flickering on the white skin. The
same light touched a strand of loosened hair. Her
face was in profile toward him, the chin pressed down
on the shoulder. It looked like a picture in its suggestion
of profound unconsciousness.</p>

<p>He pushed fearfully on the cross-bar of the pane,
and the window rose a hair&#8217;s-breadth. Then again,
and it was high enough up for him to insert his hand.
He did so, and drew forward the curtain of heavy
rep so as to hide from the sleeper the gradual stages
of his entrance. By degrees he raised it to a height
sufficient to permit the passage of his body. The curtain
shielded the girl from the current of cold air that
entered the room. He crept in softly on his hands
and knees, then rose to his feet.</p>

<p>For a moment he made no further movement, but
stood, his gaze riveted on the sleeper, watching for
a symptom of roused consciousness. She slept on
peacefully, the light sound of her breathing faintly
audible.</p>

<p>The silence of the hushed house seemed weirdly
terrifying after the tumult of the night outside. The
thief stole forward to the desk, his eye continually
turned toward her. When he reached the table she
was so far behind him that he could only see the sweep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
of her wrapper on the floor, her shoulder, and the top
of her head over the chair-back.</p>

<p>He tried the desk with an unsteady hand. It was
locked, but the insertion of a steel file he carried broke
the frail clasp. It gave with a sharp click and he
stood, his hair stirring, watching the top of her head.
It did not move, the silence resettled, he could again
hear her light, even breathing.</p>

<p>There were many papers in the desk, bundles of
letters, souvenirs of old days of affluence. He tossed
them aside with tremulous quickness until, underneath
all, he came on a long, dirty envelope and a little
chamois leather bag. He lifted the latter. It was
heavy and emitted a faint chink. The old thief&#8217;s instincts
rose in him. But he first opened the envelope,
and softly drew out the two certificates, took the one
he wanted, and put the other back. Then he opened the
mouth of the bag. The gleam of gold shone from the
aperture. Stricken with temptation he stood hesitating.</p>

<p>At that moment the fire, a heap of red ruins, fell
together with a small, clinking sound. It was no
louder noise than he had made when opening the desk,
but it contained some penetrating quality the former
had lacked. Still hesitating, with the sack of money
in his hand, he turned again to the chair. A face,
white and wide-eyed, was staring at him round the
side.</p>

<p>He gave a smothered oath and the sack dropped
from his hand to the table. The money fell from it
in a clattering heap and rolled about, in golden zigzags
in every direction. The sound roused the still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>
unawakened intelligence of the girl. She saw the paper
in his hand, half-opened. Its familiarity broke
through her dazed senses. She rose and rushed at
him gasping:</p>

<p>&#8220;The certificate! the certificate!&#8221;</p>

<p>Harney made a dash for the open window, but she
caught him by the shoulder and arm, and with the
unimpaired strength of her healthy youth struggled
with him hand to hand, reaching out for the paper he
tried to keep out of her grasp. In the fury of the moment&#8217;s
conflict, neither made any sound, but fought
like two enraged animals, rocking to and fro, panting
and clutching at each other.</p>

<p>He finally wrenched his arm free and struck her
a savage blow, aimed at her head but falling on her
shoulder, which sent her down on her knees and
then back against the fire. He thought he had stunned
her, and raised his arm again when she sprang up,
tore the paper out of his grasp and pressed it with
her hand down into the coals beside her. As she did
so, for the first time she raised her voice and shrieked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barron! Mr. Barron! Come, come! Oh
hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>From the hall Harney heard a movement and an
answering shout. With the cries echoing through
the room he beat her down against the grate, and tore
the paper, curling with fire on the edges, from her
hand. With it, he dashed through the open sash, a
shiver of glass following him.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously, Barron burst into the room.
He had been reading and had fallen asleep to be
waked by the shrieks of the girl&#8217;s voice, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
still in his ears. The falling of broken glass and a rush
of cold air from the opened window greeted him.
Piled on the table and scattered about the floor were
gold pieces. Mariposa was kneeling on the rug.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got it!&#8221; she cried wildly, and struggling to
her feet rushed to the window. &#8220;He&#8217;s got it! Oh go
after him! Stop him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got what?&#8221; he said. &#8220;No, he hasn&#8217;t got the money.
It&#8217;s all there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seized her by the arm, for she seemed as if intending
to go through the broken window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the money&mdash;not the money,&#8221; she shrieked,
wringing her hands; &#8220;the paper&mdash;the certificate! He&#8217;s
got it and gone, this way, through the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron grasped the fact that she had been robbed
of something other than the money, the loss of which
seemed to render her half distracted. With a hasty
word of reassurance, he turned and ran from the room,
springing down the stairs and across the hall. In the
instant&#8217;s pause by the window he had heard the sound
of feet on the steps below and judged that he could
get down more quickly by the stairs than by the limb
of the tree.</p>

<p>But the few minutes&#8217; start and the darkness of the
night were on the side of the thief. The roar of the
rain drowned his footsteps. Barron ran this way and
that, but neither sight nor sound of his quarry was
vouchsafed to him. The man had got away with his
booty, whatever it was.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_406.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;WITH THE STRENGTH OF HER HEALTHY YOUTH SHE
STRUGGLED WITH HIM&#8221;</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes Barron was back and found the
Garcia ladies in Mariposa&#8217;s room, ministering to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
girl who lay in a heavy swoon, stark and white on the
hearth-rug.</p>

<p>The old lady, in some wondrous and intimate d&eacute;shabille,
greeted him eagerly in Spanish, demanding what
had happened. He told her all he knew and knelt
down beside the younger Mrs. Garcia, who was attempting
with a shaking hand to pour brandy between
Mariposa&#8217;s set teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard the most awful shrieks, and we rushed
up, and here she was standing and screaming: &#8216;He&#8217;s
got it! He&#8217;s got it!&#8217; And then she fell flat, quite suddenly,
and has lain here this way ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a robber,&#8221; said the old woman, looking at
the scattered gold, &#8220;but he didn&#8217;t get her money.
What was it he took, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some papers, I think,&#8221; said Barron, &#8220;that were
evidently of value to her. I&#8217;ll lift her up and put her
on the bed and then I&#8217;ll go. As soon as she&#8217;s conscious
ask her what the man took and come and tell
me, and I&#8217;ll go right to the police station.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t leave us,&#8221; implored Mrs. Garcia, junior&mdash;&#8220;if
there are burglars anywhere round. Oh, please
don&#8217;t go. Pierpont&#8217;s away and we&#8217;d have no man in
the house. Don&#8217;t go till morning. I&#8217;m just as scared
as I can be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to be scared about. The man&#8217;s
got what he wanted, and he&#8217;ll take precious good care
not to come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but don&#8217;t go till it gets light. The window&#8217;s
broken and any one can come in who wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll wait till it gets light. I&#8217;ll lift her
up now, if you&#8217;ll get the bed ready.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>With the assistance of old Mrs. Garcia he lifted
her and carried her to the bed. One of her arms fell
limp against his shoulder as he laid her down, and
the old lady uttered an exclamation. She lifted it
up and showed him a curious red welt on the white
wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a burn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How did she get that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must have fallen against the grate,&#8221; he answered.
His eyes grew dark as they encountered the
scar. &#8220;As soon as she&#8217;s conscious tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, the young widow found him
sitting on a chair under a lamp in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said eagerly, &#8220;how is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s come back to her senses all right. But she
doesn&#8217;t seem to want to tell what he took. She says
it was a paper, and that&#8217;s all, and that she never saw
him before. Mother doesn&#8217;t think we ought to worry
her. She says she&#8217;s got a fever, and she&#8217;s going to
give her medicine to make her sleep, and not to disturb
her till she wakes up. She&#8217;s all broken up and
sort of limp and trembly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose the se&ntilde;ora knows best. It&#8217;ll be
light soon now, and I&#8217;ll go to the police station. The
se&ntilde;ora and you will stay with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia, the younger. &#8220;My goodness,
what a night it&#8217;s been! It&#8217;s lucky the man didn&#8217;t
get her money. There was quite a lot; about five hundred
dollars, I should think. Oh, my curl papers! I
forget them. Gracious, what a sight I must look!&#8221;
and she shuffled down the stairs.</p>

<p>Barron sat on till the dawn broke gray through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>
hall window. He was beginning to wonder if this
girl was the central figure of some drama, secret, intricate
and unsuspected, which was working out to
its conclusion.</p>

<p>The fears of Mrs. Garcia held Barron to the house
till the morning light was fully established. This was
late, even for the winter season, as the rain still fell
heavily, retarding the coming of day with a leaden veil.</p>

<p>He made his report at the police station, and then
went down town to his office where business detained
him till noon. It was his habit to lunch at the Lick
House, but to-day he hurried back to the Garcias&#8217;,
striding up the series of hills at top speed, urged on
by his desire to hear news of Mariposa. He burst
into the house to find it silent&mdash;the hall empty. As
he was hanging his hat on the rack, young Mrs. Garcia
appeared from the kitchen, her bang somewhat limp,
though it was still early in the day, her face looking
small and peaked after her exciting night&#8217;s vigil.</p>

<p>Mariposa was still asleep, she said in answer to his
query. The se&ntilde;ora had given her a powerful sleeping
draft and had said that the rest would be the best restorative
after such a shock. If, when she waked, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
showed symptoms of suffering or prostration, they
would send for the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you found her paper?&#8221; she asked anxiously.
&#8220;She seemed in such a way about it last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He muttered a preoccupied answer, mentioning his
visit to the police station.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it, anyway? Do <i>you</i> know?&#8221; inquired
the young woman who was not exempt from the weaknesses
of her sex.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some legal document, I think, but I don&#8217;t know.
The police can&#8217;t do much till they know what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was a will,&#8221; said the widow, whose sole
literature was that furnished by the daily press;
&#8220;though I should think if it was a will she&#8217;d have told
about it by now and not kept it hid away up there.
Anyway, she thought a lot of it, for when she came
to I told her her money was all right, and she said she
didn&#8217;t care about the money, she wanted the paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see her when she wakes,&#8221; said Barron, &#8220;and
find out what it was. Our affair now is to see that she
is not frightened again and gets well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother says to let her sleep. So that&#8217;s what
we&#8217;re going to do. No one&#8217;s going to disturb her, and
Pierpont, who got back an hour ago, has promised
not to give any lessons all afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was here interrupted by the appearance
of the Chinaman, who loungingly issued
from the kitchen, shouted an unintelligible phrase at
his mistress, and disappeared into the dining-room.
His words seemed to have meaning to her, for she
pulled off her apron, saying briskly:</p>

<p>&#8220;There, dinner&#8217;s ready and we&#8217;re going to have enchilados.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
Don&#8217;t you smell them? The boys will be
crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cautious inspection made after dinner by young
Mrs. Garcia, resulted in the information that Mariposa
still slept. Barron, who was feverishly desirous to
know how she progressed and also anxious to learn
from her the nature of the lost document, was forced
to leave without seeing her. A business engagement
of the utmost importance claimed him at his office at
two or he would have awaited her awakening.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour later before this occurred.
The drug the se&ntilde;ora had administered was a heroic
remedy, relic of the days when doctors were a rarity
and the medicine chest of the hardy Spaniard contained
few but powerful potions. The girl rose, feeling
weak and dizzy. For some time she found it difficult
to collect her thoughts and sat on the edge of her bed,
eying the disordered room with uncomprehending
glances. Bodily discomfort at first absorbed her mind.
A fever burned through her, her head ached, her limbs
felt leaden and stiff.</p>

<p>The sight of the opened desk gave the fillip to her
befogged memory, and suddenly the events of the
night rushed back on her with stunning force. She
felt, at first, that it must be a dream. But the rifled
desk, with the money which the Garcias had gathered
up and laid in a glittering heap on the table, told her
of its truth. The man&#8217;s face, yellow and flabby, with
the dark line of the shaven beard clearly marked on
his jaws, and the frightened rat&#8217;s eyes, came back
to her as he had turned in the first paralyzed moment
of fear. With hot, unsteady hands she searched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
through the scattered papers and then about the room,
in the hope that he had dropped the paper in the
struggle. But all search was fruitless. She remembered
his tearing it from her grasp as Barron&#8217;s shout
had sounded in the passage. He had escaped with it.
The irrefutable evidence of the marriage was in Essex&#8217;s
hands. He had her under his feet. It was the
end.</p>

<p>She began to dress slowly and with constant pauses.
Every movement seemed an effort; every stage of her
toilet loomed colossal before her. The one horror of
the situation kept revolving in her brain, and she
found it impossible to detach her thoughts from it
and fix them on anything else. At the same time she
could think of no way to escape, or to fight against it.</p>

<p>Next Sunday it would all be in <i>The Era</i>. Those
words seemed written in letters of fire on the walls,
and repeated themselves in maddening revolution in
her mind. It would all be there, sensationally displayed
as other old scandals had been. She saw the
tragic secret of the two lives that had sheltered hers,
the love that had been so sacred a thing written of
with all the defiling brutality of the common scribe
and his common reader, for all the world of the low
and ignoble to jeer at and spit upon.</p>

<p>She stopped in her dressing and pressed her hands
to her face. How could she live till next Sunday, and
then, when Sunday came, live through it? There were
three days yet before Sunday. Might not something
be done in three days? But she could think of nothing.
Something had happened to her brain. If there
was only some one to help her!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>And with that came the thought of Barron. A flash
of relief went through her. He would help her; he
would do something. She had no idea what, but something,
and, uplifted by the idea, she opened the door
and looked up the hall. She felt a sudden drop of
hope when she saw that his door was closed. But she
stole up the passage, watching it, not knowing what
she intended saying to him, only actuated by the desire
to throw her responsibilities on him and ask for his
help.</p>

<p>The door was ajar and she listened outside it.
There was no sound from within and no scent of cigar-smoke.
She tapped softly and receiving no answer
pushed it open and peered fearfully in. The room was
empty. The man&#8217;s clothes were thrown about carelessly,
his table littered with papers and books. From
the crevice of the opened window came the smell and
the sound of the rain, with a chill, bleak suggestion.</p>

<p>A sudden throttling sense of lonely helplessness
overwhelmed her. She stood looking blankly about,
at the ashes of cigars in a china saucer, at an old
valise gaping open in a corner. The room seemed to
her to have a vacated air, and she remembered hearing
Barron, a few days before, speak of going to the
mines again soon. Her mind leaped to the conclusion
that he had gone. Her hopes suddenly fell around
her in ruins, and in his looking-glass she saw a
blanched face that she hardly recognized as her own.</p>

<p>Stealing back to her room she sat down on the bed
again. The house was curiously quiet and in this
silence her thoughts began once more to revolve round
the one topic. Then suddenly they broke into a burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
of rebellion. She could not bear it. She must go,
somewhere, anywhere to escape. She would flee away
like a hunted animal and hide, creeping into some
dark distant place and cowering there. But where
would she go, and what would she do? The world
outside seemed one vast menace waiting to spring on
her. If her head would stop aching and the fever
that burned her body and clouded her brain would
cease for a moment, she could think and come to some
conclusion. But now&mdash;</p>

<p>And suddenly, as she thought, a whisper seemed to
come to her, clear and distinct like a revelation&mdash;&#8220;You
have your voice!&#8221;</p>

<p>It lifted her to her feet. For a moment the pain
and confusion of developing illness left her, and she
felt a thrill of returning energy. She had it still, the
one great gift neither enemies nor misfortune could
take from her&mdash;her voice!</p>

<p>The hope shook her out of the lethargy of fever,
and her mind sprang into excited action like a loosened
spring. She went to her desk and placed the
gold back in its bag. The five hundred dollars that
had seemed so meaningless had now a use. It would
take her away to Europe. With the three hundred
she still had in the bank, it would be enough to take her
to Paris and leave her something to live on. Money
went a long way over there, she had heard. She could
study and sing and become famous.</p>

<p>It all seemed suddenly possible, almost easy. Only
leaving would be hard&mdash;fearfully. She thought of the
door up the passage and the voice that in those first
days of her feebleness had called a greeting to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>
every morning; the man&#8217;s deep voice with its strong,
cheery note. And then like a peevish child, sick and
unreasonable, she found herself saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does he leave me now when I want him so?&#8221;</p>

<p>No&mdash;her voice was all she had. She would live for
it and be famous, and the year of terror and anguish
she had spent in San Francisco would become a dim
memory upon which she could some day look back
with calm. But before she went she would sing for
Pierpont and hear what he said.</p>

<p>The thought had hardly formed in her mind when
she was out in the hall and stealing noiselessly down
the stairs of the silent house. It struck her as odd
that the house should be so quiet, as these were the
hours in which Pierpont&#8217;s pupils usually made the
welkin resound with their efforts. Perhaps he was
out. But this was not so, for in the lower hall she
met the girl with the fair hair and prominent blue
eyes who possessed the fine soprano voice she had
so often listened to, and who in response to her query
told her that Mr. Pierpont was in, but not giving lessons
this afternoon.</p>

<p>In answer to her knock she heard his &#8220;come in&#8221;
and opened the door. He was sitting on a divan idly
turning over some loose sheets of music. The large,
sparsely furnished room&mdash;it was in reality the back
drawing-room of the house&mdash;looked curiously gray
and cold in the drear afternoon light. It was only
slightly furnished&mdash;his bed and toilet articles being
in a curtained alcove. In the center of its unadorned,
occupied bareness, the grand piano, gleaming richly,
stood open, the stool in front of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>&#8220;Miss Moreau,&#8221; he said, starting to his feet, &#8220;I
thought you were sick in bed. How are you? You&#8217;ve
had a dreadful experience. I&#8217;ve been sending away
my pupils because I was told you were asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m quite well now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;only my head
aches a little. Yes, I was frightened last night&mdash;a
burglar came in, crept up the bough of the pepper-tree.
I was dreadfully frightened then, but I&#8217;m all
right now. I&#8217;ve come to sing for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To sing for me!&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;but you&#8217;re not
well enough to sing. You&#8217;ve had a bad fright and
you look&mdash;excuse me&#8221;&mdash;he took her hand&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;re
burning up with fever. Take my advice and go upstairs,
and as soon as Mrs. Garcia comes in we&#8217;ll get a
doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no!&#8221; she said almost violently; &#8220;I&#8217;m quite
well now. My hand&#8217;s hot and so is my head, but that&#8217;s
natural after the fright I had last night. I want to
sing for you now and see what you say about my
voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you know, you can&#8217;t do yourself justice and
I can&#8217;t form a fair opinion. Why do you want to sing
this afternoon when you wouldn&#8217;t all winter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind telling you. I&#8217;m
going to Europe to study. I&#8217;ve just made up my
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to Europe! Isn&#8217;t that very sudden? But
it will be splendid! When are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon&mdash;in a day or two&mdash;as soon as I can get my
things packed in my trunks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously. Her manner, which
was usually calm and deliberate, was marked by tremulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
restlessness. She spoke rapidly and like one
laboring under suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she said, going to the piano stool and pushing
it nearer the keyboard, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be very busy now and
I don&#8217;t want to waste any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved reluctantly to the piano and seated himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you your music?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I can sing what some of your pupils do.
I can sing &#8216;Knowest thou the land?&#8217; and Mrs. Burrell
sings that. Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her feverish haste and nervousness impressed him
more than ever as her hands tossed aside the sheets
of piled-up music, throwing them about the piano and
snatching at them as they slipped to the floor. From
there he picked up the &#8216;Mignon&#8217; aria which she had
overlooked and spreading it on the rack struck the
opening notes. She leaned over him to see the first
line and he felt that she was trembling violently. He
raised his hands and wheeled round on the stool.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Moreau,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I truly don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re
well enough to sing. Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better put
it off till to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;I&#8217;m going to now. I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;m anxious
to. I must. Begin again, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned obediently and began again to play the
chords of accompaniment. He had been for a long
time intensely anxious to hear her voice, of which he
had heard so much. It irritated him now to have her
determined to sing when she was obviously ill and
still suffering from the effects of her fright.</p>

<p>The accompaniment reached the point where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>
voice joins it. He played softly, alert for the first
rich notes. Mariposa&#8217;s chest rose with an inflation of
air and she began to sing.</p>

<p>A sound, harsh, veiled and thin, filled the room.
There was no volume, nor resonance, nor beauty in it.
It was the ghost of a voice.</p>

<p>The teacher was so shocked that for a moment he
stumbled in the familiar accompaniment. Then he
went on, bending his head low over the keys, fearful
of her seeing his face. Sounds unmusical, rasping,
and discordant came from her lips. Everything that
had once made it rich and splendid was gone, the very
volume of it had dwindled to a thin, muffled thread,
the color had flown from every tone.</p>

<p>For a bar or two she went on, then she stopped.
Pierpont dared not turn at first. But he heard her
behind him say hoarsely:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what&mdash;is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he wheeled round and saw her with wild eyes
and white lips.</p>

<p>For a moment he could say nothing. Her appearance
struck him with alarm, and he sat dumb on the
stool staring at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;What has happened to it?
Where is my voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;certainly not in good condition,&#8221; he
stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone,&#8221; she answered in a wail of agony; &#8220;it&#8217;s
gone. My voice has gone! What shall I do? It&#8217;s
gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fright of last night has affected it,&#8221; he said,
speaking as kindly as he could, &#8220;and you&#8217;re not well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
I told you you were feverish and ought not to sing.
Rest will probably restore it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me try it again,&#8221; she said wildly. &#8220;It may be
better. Play again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He played over the opening bars again, and once
more she drew the deep breath that in the past had always
brought with it so much of exultation and began
to sing. The same feeble sounds, obscured as though
passing through a thick, muffling medium, hoarse, flat,
unlovely, came with labor from her parted lips.</p>

<p>They broke suddenly into a wild animal cry of
despair. Pierpont rose from the stool and went toward
her where she stood with her arms drooping by her
sides, pallid and terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look like that,&#8221; he said, taking her hand;
&#8220;there&#8217;s no doubt the voice has been injured. But
rest does a great deal, and after a shock like last
night&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She tore herself away from him and ran to the door
crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my voice! My voice! It was all I had!&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed her into the hall, not knowing what to
say in the face of such a calamity, only anxious to
offer her some consolation. But she ran from him,
up the stairs with a frantic speed. As he put his foot
on the lower step he heard her door.</p>

<p>He turned round and went back slowly to his room.
He was shocked and amazed, and a little relieved that
he had failed to catch her for he had no words ready
for such a misfortune. Her voice was completely
gone. She was unquestionably ill and nervous&mdash;but&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>
He sat down on the divan, shaking his head. He
had never heard a voice more utterly lost and wrecked.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Barron&#8217;s business engagement detained him longer
than he had expected. The heavy rain was shortening
the already short February day with a premature
dusk when he opened the gate of the Garcia house
and mounted the steps.</p>

<p>He had made a cursory investigation of the ground
under the pepper-tree when he went out in the early
morning. Now, before the light died, he again stepped
under its branches for a more thorough survey. The
foliage was so thick that no grass grew where the
tree&#8217;s shadow fell, and the rain sifted through it in
occasional dribbles or shaken showers. The bare
stretch of ground was now an expanse of mud, interspersed
with puddles. Here and there a footprint
still remained, full of water. He moved about the
base of the tree studying these, then looking up into
the branch along which the burglar had crept to the
balcony. What paper could the girl have possessed of
sufficient value to lure a man to such risks?</p>

<p>With his mind full of this thought his glance
dropped to the root of the trunk. A piece of burnt paper,
half covered with the trampled mud, caught his
eye, and he picked it up and absently glanced at it. He
was about to throw it over the fence into the road, when
he saw the name of Jacob Shackleton. The next moment
his eyes were riveted on the printed lines here
and there filled in with writing. He moved so that the
full light fell on it through a break in the branches.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
It was a minute or two before he grasped its real meaning.
But he knew the name of Lucy Fraser, too.
Mariposa had once told him it had been her mother&#8217;s
maiden name.</p>

<p>For a space he stood motionless under the tree, staring
at the paper, focusing his mind on it, seizing on
waifs and strays from the past that surged to the surface
of his memory. It dazed him at first. Then he
began to understand. The mysterious drama that environed
the girl upstairs began to grow clear to him.
This was the document that had been stolen from her
last night, the loss of which had thrown her into a
frenzy of despair&mdash;the record of a marriage between
her mother and Jake Shackleton.</p>

<p>Without stopping to think further he thrust it into
his pocket and ran to the house. As he mounted the
porch steps the scene of his first meeting with Mariposa
flashed suddenly like a magic-lantern picture across
his mind. He heard her hysterical cry of&mdash;&#8220;He was
my father!&#8221; Another veil of the mystery seemed lifted.</p>

<p>And now he shrank from penetrating further, for
he began to see. If Mariposa had some sore secret
to hide let her keep it shut in her own breast. All he
had to do was to give the paper to her as soon as he
could. In the moment&#8217;s passage of the balcony and
the pause while he inserted his latch-key in the door
he tried to think how he could restore it to her without
letting her think he had read it. The key turned
and as the door gave he decided that it must be given
her at once without wasting time or bothering about
comforting lies.</p>

<p>He burst into the hall and then stood still, the door-handle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>
in his hand. In the dim light, the two Garcia
ladies and the two boys met his eyes, standing in a
group at the foot of the stairs. There was something
in their faces and attitudes that bespoke uneasiness
and anxiety. Their four pairs of eyes were fastened on
him with curious alarmed gravity.</p>

<p>He kicked the door shut and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Miss Moreau?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question seemed to increase their disquietude.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know where she is,&#8221; said young Mrs.
Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she in her room?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;that&#8217;s what&#8217;s so funny. I thought she was
sleeping an awful long time and I just peeked in and
she isn&#8217;t there. And Benito&#8217;s been all over the house
and can&#8217;t find her. It seems so crazy of her to go out
in all this rain, but her outside things are not in the
closet or anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood silent for a moment, eying one another
with faces of disturbed query.</p>

<p>The opening of Pierpont&#8217;s door roused them. The
young man appeared in the aperture and then came
slowly forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Miss Moreau?&#8221; he said to young
Mrs. Garcia.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Barron hurriedly; &#8220;but have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she was down in my room this afternoon
singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Singing!&#8221; echoed the others in wide-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;m rather anxious about her. That&#8217;s
why I came out when I heard your voices. She&#8217;s had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span>
a pretty severe disappointment, I&#8217;m afraid. She seems
to have lost her voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost her voice!&#8221; ejaculated Mrs. Garcia in a low
gasp of horror. &#8220;Good heavens!&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys looked from one to the other with the
round eyes of growing fear and dread. The calamity,
as announced by Pierpont, did not seem adequate for
the consternation it caused, but an oppressive sense of
apprehension was in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;What made her want to sing?&#8221; said the widow;
&#8220;she was too sick to sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I told her, but she insisted. She was
determined to. She said she was going to Europe to
study.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going to Europe!&#8221; It was Barron&#8217;s deep voice
that put the question this time, Mrs. Garcia being too
astonished by this last piece of intelligence to have
breath for speech. &#8220;When was she going to Europe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a day or two&mdash;as soon as she could pack her
trunks, she said. I don&#8217;t really think she was quite
accountable for what she said. She was burning with
a fever and she seemed in a tremendously wrought-up
state. I think her fright of the night before had
quite upset her. I tried to cheer her up, but she ran
away as if she was frantic. Have any of you seen
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Mrs. Garcia, her voice curiously flat.
&#8220;She&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone?&#8221; echoed Pierpont. &#8220;Gone where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t any of us know. But she&#8217;s not in the
house anywhere. And now it&#8217;s getting dark and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause, one of those pregnant pauses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
of mute anxiety while each eyed the other with glances
full of an alarmed surmise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the robber came and took her away,&#8221; said
Benito in a voice of terror.</p>

<p>No one paid any attention. As if by common consent
all present fastened questioning eyes on Barron.
He stood looking down, his brows knit. The silence
of dumb uneasiness was broken by the entrance of the
Chinaman from the kitchen. With the expressionless
phlegm of his race he lit the two hall gas-jets, gently
but firmly moving the se&ntilde;ora out of his way, and paying
no attention to the silent group at the stair foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ching,&#8221; said Barron suddenly, &#8220;have you seen Miss
Moreau this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned the Celestial, carefully adjusting
the tap of the second gas, &#8220;she go out hap-past four.
She heap hurry. She look welly bad&mdash;heap sick I
guess; no umblella; get awful wet.&#8221;</p>

<p>With his noiseless tread he retreated up the passage
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said Barron suddenly. &#8220;She&#8217;s just
possibly gone out to see some one and will be back
soon. But no umbrella in this rain! Have her room
warm and everything ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned round and in an instant was gone. The
little group at the stairpost looked at one another with
pale faces. It was possible that Mariposa had gone
out to see some one. But the dread of disaster was at
every heart.</p>

<p>It had been close upon half-past two when Harney
had left the house in Bush Street. Essex at the window
had heard the sound of his retreating feet soon
lost in the rush of the rain, and had then returned to
the fire. He had made a close calculation of the time
Harney should take. To go and come ought not to
occupy more than a half-hour. The theft, itself, if no
mischances occurred, should be accomplished in ten
or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>As the hands of the clock on the table drew near
three, the man rose from his post by the fire and began
to move restlessly about the room. The house was
wrapped in the dead stillness of sleep, round which the
turmoil of the storm circled and upon which it seemed
to press. Pausing to listen he could hear the creaks
and groan of the old walls, as the wind buffeted them.
Once, thinking he heard a furtive step, he went to
the door, opened it and peered out into the blackness
of the hall. The stairs still creaked as if to a light
ascending foot, but his eyes encountered nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
the impenetrable darkness, charged with the familiar
smell of stale smoke.</p>

<p>Back in his room he went to the window and throwing
it wide, leaned out listening. The rain fell with
a continuous drumming rustle, through which the
chinks and gurgles of water caught in small channels
penetrated with a near-by clearness. Here and there
the darkness broke away in splinters from a sputtering
lamp, and where its light touched, everything
gleamed and glistened. Gusts of wind rose and fell,
tore the wet bushes in the garden below, and banged
a shutter on an adjacent house.</p>

<p>Essex left the window, drawing the curtain to shut
its light from the street. It was a quarter past three.
If at four Harney had not returned he would go after
him. The thief might easily have missed his footing
in the tree and have fallen, and be lying beneath it,
stunned, dead perhaps, the papers in his hand.</p>

<p>The clock hands moved on toward twenty&mdash;twenty-five
minutes past. The creaking came from the stairs
again, exactly, to the listening ear, like the soft sound
of a cautiously-mounting step. From the cupboard
came a curious loud tick and then a series of rending
cracks. It made Essex start guiltily, and swearing
under his breath, he again turned toward the window
and, as he did so, caught the sound of hurrying feet.
He drew the curtain and leaned out. Above the uproar
of the night he heard the quick, regular thud of
the feet of a runner, rushing onward through the
storm, and then, across the gleam of a lamp, a dark
figure shot, with head down, flying.</p>

<p>He dropped the curtain and waited, immense relief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[428]</span>
at his heart. In a moment he heard the footsteps stop
at the gate, furtively ascend the stairs of the two terraces,
and then the stealthy grating of the door. He
silently pushed his own door open that the light might
guide the ascending man, and he heard Harney&#8217;s loud
breathing as he crept up.</p>

<p>The thief rose up out of the gulf of darkness like
an apparition of terror. He dropped into a chair, his
face gray, white and pinched, the sound of his rasping
breaths, drawn with pain from the bottom of his
lungs, filling the room. He was incapable of speech,
and Essex, pouring him out whisky, was forced to take
the glass from his shaking hand and hold it to his
lips. From his soaked clothes and the cap that
crowned his head, like a saturated woolen rag, water
streamed. But the rain had not been able to efface
from his coat a caking of mud that half-covered one
arm and shoulder, and there was blood on one of his
hands. He had evidently fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got it?&#8221; said Essex, putting the glass
down.</p>

<p>The other nodded and let his head sink on the chair-back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dead,&#8221; he gasped, &#8220;but I done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it? Give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man made a faint movement of assent, but
evidently had not force enough to produce the paper
and lay limp in the chair, Essex watching him impatiently.
Presently he put his feeble hand out for
the glass and drank again. The rattling loudness of
his breathing moderated. Without moving his head
he turned his eyes on Essex and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[429]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m most killed&mdash;I&#8217;m all shook up. I fell coming
down the tree, some way&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how far&mdash;but
I got it all right. She fought like a wildcat, tried to
burn it&mdash;but I got it. Then she hollered and a man
answered. I knew it was a man&#8217;s voice, and I made
a dash for the winder only jest in time. I&#8217;m cut
somewheres&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised the hand with the blood on it and fumbled
at his coat-sleeve. The other hand was smeared with
blood from the contact.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a pig,&#8221; he said in a low voice, and pulled out
a rag of handkerchief which he tried to push up his
sleeve; &#8220;I&#8217;m cut somewheres all right, but I don&#8217;t know
where.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the paper and take your things off. You&#8217;re
dripping all over everything,&#8221; said Essex, extending
his hand.</p>

<p>Harney sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno how I done it,&#8221; he said; &#8220;how I got down.
The man was right on my heels. When I fell I saw
him, pullin&#8217; her up on her feet&mdash;I saw that through the
winder. Then I riz up and I went&mdash;God, how I went!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had stuffed his handkerchief up his sleeve by this
time, and now put his bloody tremulous hand into the
outer breast-pocket of his coat. As the hand fumbled
about the opening he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t stop to look no more nor take no risks. I
wanted to git away from thar and I tell you I lit out,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, his jaw dropped, his nerveless figure
stiffened, a look of animal terror came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; he almost yelled, staring at Essex.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[430]</span>&#8220;How the devil should I know! Where did you put
it? Isn&#8217;t it there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex himself had suddenly paled. He stood erect
before the crouched and trembling figure of his partner,
his eyes fiercely intense.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t here,&#8221; cried Harney, his hand clawing about
in the pocket. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t there. Oh Lordy, Lordy!
I&#8217;ve lost it! It&#8217;s gone. It fell out when I came off
the tree. I fell. I told you I fell. Didn&#8217;t I tell you
I fell?&#8221; he shouted, as if he had been contradicted.</p>

<p>He rose up, his face pasty white, wringing his hands
like a woman. There was something grotesque and
almost overdone in his terror, but his pallor and the
fear in his eyes were real.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost it!&#8221; cried Essex. &#8220;No more of those lies!
Give me the paper, you dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you hear me say I ain&#8217;t got it? Ain&#8217;t I told
you I fell? When I jumped for the tree I jest smashed
it down into my pocket. I had to have both hands to
climb. And I suppose I ain&#8217;t pressed it in tight enough.
God, man, it was ten years in San Quentin for me if
I&#8217;d lost two minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex drew closer, his mouth tight, his eyes fixed
with a fiercely compelling gaze on the wretch before
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think you can make anything by stealing that
paper. Give it up; give it up now; I&#8217;ve got you here,
and I&#8217;ll know what you&#8217;ve done with it before you leave
or you&#8217;ll never leave at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lost it, and that&#8217;s what I done with it. If you
want it, come on with me now and look round under
that tree. Ain&#8217;t you understood I fell sideways from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[431]</span>
the branch to the ground? Look at my hand&mdash;&#8221; he
held up his arm, pulling the muddy sleeve back from
the blood-stained wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; said Essex, without moving. &#8220;You
were gone nearly an hour. Where have you hidden
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nowheres. It took time. I had to clim&#8217; up careful,
&#8217;cause she had a light burning, and I thought she
was awake. Why can&#8217;t you believe me? What can
I do with it alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can blackmail Mrs. Shackleton well enough
alone. Give me that paper, or tell me where you put it,
or, by God, I&#8217;ll kill you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fear of the man that owned him gave Harney the air
of guilt. He backed away in an access of pallid terror,
shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t lying. Why can&#8217;t yer believe me? It took
time&mdash;it took time! Ain&#8217;t I told you I fell? Look at
the mud; and feel, feel in every pocket.&#8221; He seized
on them and tore the insides outward. &#8220;I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; you
the whole truth. I ain&#8217;t got it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it, then? You&#8217;ll tell me where you&#8217;ve
hidden it, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Essex made a sudden leap forward and caught the
man by his neck-cloth and collar. In his blind alarm
Harney was given fictitious strength, and he tore himself
loose and rushed for the door. Essex&#8217;s hat, coat and
stick lay on the table. Without thought or premeditation
their owner seized the cane&mdash;a heavy malacca&mdash;by
the end, flew round the table, and as Harney turned the
door-handle, brought the knob of the loaded cane down
on the crown of his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[432]</span>It struck with a thud and sent the water squirting
from the saturated cap. The thief, without cry or
word, spun round, waving his hands in the air, and
then fell heavily face downward. For a moment he
quivered, and once or twice made a convulsive movement,
then lay still, the water running from his clothes
along the floor.</p>

<p>With the cane still in his hand, Essex came around
the table and looked at him. For a space he stood
staring, his hand resting on the edge of the table, his
neck craned forward, his face set in a rigid intensity
of observation. The sudden silence that had succeeded
to the loud tones of Harney&#8217;s voice was singularly
deep and solemn. The room seemed held in a spell of
stillness, almost awful in its suddenness and isolation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; he said in a low voice. &#8220;Harney, get up.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no response, and he leaned forward and
pushed at the motionless figure with the cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn!&#8221; he said under his breath, &#8220;he&#8217;s fainted.&#8221;</p>

<p>And throwing the cane away, he approached the
man and bent over him. There was no sound of
breathing or pulse of life about the sodden figure with
its hidden face. Drops formed on Essex&#8217;s forehead
as he turned it over. Then, as it confronted him, livid
with fallen jaw and a gleam of white between the
wrinkled eyelid, the drops ran down his face.</p>

<p>With a hand that shook as Harney&#8217;s had a few moments
before he felt the pulse and then tore the shirt
open and tried the heart. His face was white as the
man&#8217;s on the floor as he poured whisky down the
throat that refused to swallow. Finally, tearing off
his coat, he knelt beside his victim and tried every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[433]</span>
means in his power to bring back life into the miserable
body in which he had only recognized a tool of his
own. But there was no response. The minutes ticked
on, and there was no glimmer of intelligence in the
cold indifference of the eyes, no warmth round the
stilled heart, no flutter of breath at the slack, gray lips.</p>

<p>The night was still dark, the rain in his ears, when
he rose to his feet. A horror unlike anything he had
even imagined was on him. All the things in life he
had struggled for seemed shriveled to nothing. The
whole worth of his existence was contained in the unlovely
body on the floor. To bring life back to it
he would have given his dearest ambition&mdash;sacrificed
love, money, happiness&mdash;all for which he had
held life valuable, and thought himself blessed. What
a few hours before were ends to struggle and sin for
seemed now of no moment to him. Mariposa had
faded to a dim, undesired shadow; the millions she
stood for to dross he would have passed without a
thought. How readily would he have given it all to
bring back the breath to the creature he had held as a
worm beneath his foot!</p>

<p>He seized the table-cloth and threw it over the face
whose solemn, tragic calm filled him with a sick dread.
Then with breathless haste he flung some clothes into
a valise and made the fire burn high with the letters
and papers he threw on it at intervals. The first carts
of the morning had begun their rattling course through
the stirred darkness when he crept out, a haggard,
hunted man.</p>

<p>He had to hide himself in unfrequented corners,
cower beneath the shadow of trees on park benches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[434]</span>
till the light strengthened and morning shook the city
into life. Then, as its reawakening tides began to
surge round him, he made a furtive way&mdash;for the
first time in his life fearful of his fellow men&mdash;to the
railway station, and there took the earliest south-bound
train for the Mexican border.</p>

<p>The fire had died down, the leaden light of coming
day was filtering in through the crack between the
half-drawn curtains, when the shrouded shape on the
floor moved and a deep groan broke upon the stillness.
Another followed it, groans of physical anguish beating
on awakening consciousness. An early riser from
the floor above heard them as he stole downward,
stopped, listened, knocked, then receiving no reply,
opened the door and peered fearfully in. In the dim
room, cut with a sword of faint light, he saw the
covered shape, and, as he stood terrified, heard the
groan repeated and saw the drapery twitched. Shouting
his fears over the balustrade, he rushed in, flung
the curtains wide, tore off the table-cloth, and in the
rush of pallid light, saw Harney, leaden eyed, withered
to a waxen pallor, smeared with the blood of the cut
wrist which he feebly moved, struggling back to existence.</p>

<small>HAVE YOU COME AT LAST</small></h3>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">&#8220;Yesterday this day&#8217;s madness did prepare.&#8221;</div>

</div></div></div>


<p>At ten o&#8217;clock Barron returned to the Garcia house.
His search for Mariposa in such accustomed haunts as
the Mercantile Library, the shops on Kearney Street,
and Mrs. Willers&#8217;, had been fruitless. Mrs. Willers
was again at <i>The Trumpet</i> office, where another and
more important portion of the Woman&#8217;s Page was going
to press, but Edna was at home, and told Barron
that neither she nor her mother had seen Mariposa
since the lesson of the day before.</p>

<p>In returning to the house he had hopes of finding her
there. From the first his anxiety had been keen.
Now, as he put his key in the lock, it clutched his heart
with a suffocating force. The house was silent as he
entered, and then the sound of his step in the hall
called the head of young Mrs. Garcia to the opened
door of the kitchen. The first glimpse of her face
told him Mariposa had not returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got her?&#8221; cried the young woman
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, his voice sounding colorless and
flat. &#8220;I thought she might be back here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span>Mrs. Garcia shook her head and withdrew it. He
followed her into the kitchen, where she and the se&ntilde;ora
were sitting by the stove. A large fire was burning,
the room was warm and bright&mdash;the trim, finically
neat kitchen of a clean Chinaman. To the se&ntilde;ora&#8217;s
quick phrase of inquiry, the younger woman answered
with a sentence in Spanish. For a moment the silence
of sick anxiety held the trio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you go to Mrs. Willers&#8217;?&#8221; said young Mrs.
Garcia, trying to speak with some lightness of tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she&#8217;s not been there since yesterday. I&#8217;ve
been everywhere I could think of where it was likely
she would be. I couldn&#8217;t find a trace of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&#8217;s she&#8217;s gone to Europe, or is going to-morrow,
as she told Pierpont. She took her money. We
looked after you&#8217;d gone, and it wasn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be too late to find out to-night if she&#8217;s gone.
The ticket offices are closed. I can&#8217;t think she&#8217;s done
that&mdash;without a word to any one. It&#8217;s not like her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The se&ntilde;ora here asked what they said. Barron, who
spoke Spanish indifferently, signaled to the young
woman to answer for him. She did so, the se&ntilde;ora
listening intently. At the end of her daughter-in-law&#8217;s
speech she shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she has not gone,&#8221; she said slowly in Spanish.
&#8220;She could not take that journey. She was not able&mdash;she
was sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick, and out on such a night with all that money!&#8221;
moaned her daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>Barron got up with a smothered ejaculation. He
knew more than either of the women. The attempt at
robbery the night before had failed. To-night the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[437]</span>
herself had disappeared. What might it all mean?
He was afraid to think.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in probably
in four or five hours to see if, by any chance, she&#8217;s come
back. You have everything ready&mdash;fires and warm
clothes and things to eat in case I bring her with me.
The rain&#8217;s worse than ever. Ching says she had no
umbrella.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without more conversation he left, the two women
bestirring themselves to make ready the supper he had
ordered. At three o&#8217;clock he returned again to find
the se&ntilde;ora sitting alone, by the ruddy stove, Mrs.
Garcia, the younger, being asleep on a sofa in the
boys&#8217; room. The old lady persuaded him to drink a
cup of coffee she had kept warm, and, as she gave it
him, looked with silent compassion into his haggard
face.</p>

<p>When day broke he had not again appeared. By
this time the household was in a ferment of open
alarm. The boys were retained from school, as it was
felt they might be needed for messages. Pierpont undertook
to visit all Mariposa&#8217;s pupils, in the dim hope
of finding through them some clue to her movements,
though it was well known she was on intimate terms
with none of them. Soon after breakfast Mrs. Willers
appeared, uneasy, and by the time the now weeping
Mrs. Garcia had told her all, pale and deeply disturbed.</p>

<p>She repaired to <i>The Trumpet</i> office without loss of
time, and there acquainted her chief with the story of
Miss Moreau&#8217;s disappearance, not neglecting to mention
the burglary of the night before, which even to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>
the women, having no knowledge of its real import,
seemed to indicate a sinister connection with subsequent
events. Winslow did not disappoint Mrs. Willers
by pooh-poohing the matter, as she had half imagined
he would; a young lady&#8217;s disappearance for
twelve hours not being a subject for such tragic consternation.
He seemed extremely worried&mdash;in fact,
showed an anxiety that struck the head of the Woman&#8217;s
Page as almost odd. He assured her that if Miss
Moreau was not heard from that day by midday he
would offer secretly to the police department the largest
reward ever given in San Francisco, for any trace or
tidings of her.</p>

<p>Meantime Barron, having assured himself by visits
to all the ticket offices that she had not left the city on
any train, had finally taken his case to the police. It
had been in their hands only an hour or two, when
young Shackleton&#8217;s offer of what, in even those extravagant
days seemed an enormous reward, was communicated
to the department. It put life into the
somewhat dormant energies of the officers detailed on
the case. Mariposa had not been missing twenty-four
hours when the search for her was spreading over
the face of the city, where she had been so insignificant
a unit, in a thorough and secret network of investigation.</p>

<p>The day wore away with maddening slowness to the
women in the house, whose duty it was to sit and wait.
To Barron, whose anxiety had been intensified by the
torture of his deeper knowledge of the girl&#8217;s strange
circumstances, existence seemed only bearable as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
directed to finding her. He did not dare now to pause or
think. Without stopping to eat or rest he continued his
search, now with the detectives, now alone. Several
times in the course of the day he reappeared at the Garcia
house, drawn thither by the hope that she might
have returned. The se&ntilde;ora, with the curious tranquillity
of the very old which seems not to need the repairing
processes of sleep or food, was always to be found sitting
by the kitchen stove, upon which some dish or
drink simmered for him. He rarely stopped to take
either. But returning in the early dusk, he was grateful
to find that she had a dry overcoat hanging before
the fire for him. The rain still fell in torrents, and
the long day spent at its mercy had soaked him.</p>

<p>It was between ten and eleven at night that the old
lady and her daughter-in-law, sitting before the stove
as they had done the evening before, again heard his
step and his key. This time there was no pretense at
expectation on either side. His first glance inside the
room showed him the heavy dejection of the two faces
turned toward him. They, on their part, saw him
pale and drawn, as by a month&#8217;s illness. They had
heard nothing. No investigation of which they were
aware had brought in a crumb of comfort. He had
heard worse than nothing. There had been talk at the
police station that evening of the finding of George
Harney, suffering from concussion of the brain, and
the sudden departure of Barry Essex, believed to be
his assailant.</p>

<p>This information added the last straw to Barron&#8217;s
agony of apprehension. It seemed as if a plot had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span>
culminated in those two days, a plot dark and inexplicable,
in which the woman he loved was in some
mysterious way involved.</p>

<p>He was standing by the stove responding to the
somber queries of the women, when the sound of feet
on the porch steps suddenly transfixed them all.
Young Mrs. Garcia screamed, while the old lady sat
with head bent sidewise listening. Before Barron
could get to the door a soft ring at the bell had drawn
another scream from the younger woman, who, nevertheless,
followed him and stood peeping into the hall,
clinging to the door-post.</p>

<p>The opened door sent a flood of light over three
figures huddled in the glass porch&mdash;two men, a detective
and policeman, Barron already knew, and a third,
a stranger to him, whose face against the shadowy
background looked fresh and boyish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Barron, we&#8217;re lucky to strike you this way
at the first shot,&#8221; said the detective. &#8220;We think we&#8217;ve
found the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Found her? Where? Have you got her there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we&#8217;re not certain yet if it&#8217;s the right one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man, as he spoke, entered the hall, the policeman
and the stranger following him. Under the flare
of the two gas-jets they looked big, ungainly figures
in their smoking rubber capes that ran rillets of water
on the floor. The third, revealed in the full light, was
a boy of some fourteen or fifteen years, well dressed
and with the air of a gentleman.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman came to the station a half-hour
ago,&#8221; said the policeman, indicating the stranger, &#8220;with
a story of finding a lady on his own grounds, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[441]</span>
thought from his description it was the one you&#8217;re looking
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron directed on the youth a glance that would
have pried open the lips of the Sphinx.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she look like? Where is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in our garden,&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;under some
trees. She looks tall and has on black clothes, and has
dark red hair and a very white face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Garcia gave a loud cry from the background.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mariposa sure,&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;Is she alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alive!&#8221; echoed the youth. &#8220;Oh, yes, she&#8217;s quite
alive, but I don&#8217;t know whether she&#8217;s exactly in her
right mind. She&#8217;s sort of queer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron had brushed past him into the streaming
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he shouted back. &#8220;Good Lord, come
quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the foot of the zigzag stairs he saw the two gleaming
lights of a hack. With the other men clattering
at his heels, he dashed down the steps, and was in it,
chafing and swearing, while they were fumbling for
the latch of the gate.</p>

<p>As the boy, after giving the coachman an address,
scrambled in beside him, he said peremptorily:</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you find her? Tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About two hours ago. My dog found her. I live,
I and my mother, on the slope of Russian Hill. It&#8217;s
quite a big place with a lot of trees. I went down to
get Jack (that&#8217;s my dog) at the vet&#8217;s, where he&#8217;s been
for a week, and I was bringing him home. When we
got to the top of the steps he began sniffing round and
barking, and then he ran to a place where there&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[442]</span>
little sort of bunch of fir-trees and barked and jumped
round, and went in among the trees. I followed him
to see what was up, and all of a sudden I heard some
one say from under the trees: &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s only a dog.&#8217; I was
scared and ran into the house and got a lamp, and when
I came out with my mother, and we went in among the
trees, there was a woman in there, who was lying on
the ground. When she saw us she sort of sat up, as
if she&#8217;d been asleep, and said: &#8216;Is it Sunday yet?&#8217;
We saw her distinctly; she was staring right at us.
She didn&#8217;t look as if she was crazy, but we both thought
she was. She was terribly white. We knew she
couldn&#8217;t be drunk, because she was like a lady&mdash;she
spoke that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;and then,&#8221; said Barron, &#8220;what did she
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said again, &#8216;It isn&#8217;t Sunday yet?&#8217; and mother
said, &#8216;No, not yet,&#8217; and we went away. I ran to the
police office, but we left one of the Chinamen to watch
so she wouldn&#8217;t get away, &#8217;cause we didn&#8217;t know what
was the matter with her. We&#8217;ll be there in a minute
now. It isn&#8217;t far.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hack, which had been rattling round corners at
top speed, now began to ascend. Barron could see
the gaunt flank of Russian Hill looming above them,
with here and there a house hanging to a ridge or
balanced on a slope. The lights of the town dropped
away on their right in a series of sparkling terraces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you guess it&#8217;s the lady you&#8217;re hunting?&#8221; said
the policeman politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost certain it is,&#8221; answered Barron. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you make this man go faster?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span>&#8220;The hill&#8217;s pretty steep here,&#8221; said the guardian of
the city&#8217;s peace. &#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to think he could
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re almost there,&#8221; said the boy; &#8220;it&#8217;s just that
house where the aloe is&mdash;there on the top of that high
wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron looked in the direction, and saw high above
them, on the top of a wall like the rampart of a fortress,
the faint outline of a house and the black masses of
trees etched against the only slightly paler sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any aloe,&#8221; he growled; &#8220;is that the
house you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;I guess it&#8217;s too dark for
the aloe to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a scrambling and jolting the horses began what
appeared an even steeper climb than that of the block
before. The beasts seemed to dig their hoofs into the
crevices between the cobbles and to clamber perilously
up. With an oath Barron kicked open the door and
sprang out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boy,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand this
snail of a carriage any longer.&#8221; And he set out running
up the hill.</p>

<p>The boy, who was light of foot and young, kept up
with him, but the two heavier men, who had followed,
were left behind, puffing and blowing in the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly the great wall, at the base of which they
ran, was crossed by a flight of stairs that made two
oblique stripes across its face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up the stairs,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>And Barron, without reply, turned and began the
ascent at the same breakneck speed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[444]</span>&#8220;You may as well let me go first,&#8221; gasped his conductor
from behind him. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know the way,
and you might scare the Chinaman. He said he had
a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barron stood aside for him to pass and then followed
the nimble figure as it darted up the second
flight. The boy was evidently nearing the top, when
he sang out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there, Lee! It&#8217;s me coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an unmistakable Chinese guttural from
somewhere, and then Barron himself rose above the
stair-top. A black mass of garden lay before him,
with the bulk of a large house a short distance back.
Many windows were lit, and in one he saw a woman
standing. Their light fell out over the garden, barring
it with long rectangular stripes of brilliance. The wild
bark of the dog rose from the house and on the unseen
walk the Chinaman&#8217;s footsteps could be heard crunching
the pebbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she there yet, Lee?&#8221; said the boy in a hissing
whisper.</p>

<p>The Chinaman&#8217;s affirmative grunt rose from the
darkness of massed trees, into which his footsteps
continued to retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; said his conductor to Barron. &#8220;But
hang it all, it&#8217;s so dark we can&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; said Barron. &#8220;Never mind the
light. Show me where she is. Mariposa!&#8221; he said
suddenly, in a voice which, though low, had a quality
so thrilling it might have penetrated the ear of death.</p>

<p>The garden, rain-swept and rustling, grew quiet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[445]</span>
The sound of the Chinaman&#8217;s footsteps ceased, even
the panting breath of the boy was suddenly suspended.</p>

<p>In this moment of pause, when nature seemed to
quell her riot to listen, a woman&#8217;s voice, sweet and soft,
rose out of impenetrable darkness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who called me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sound broke the agony that had congealed Barron&#8217;s
heart. With a shout he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s I, dearest. Where are you? Come to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice rose again, faint, but with joy in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, have you come&mdash;have you come, at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a rush forward into the blackness before
him. At the same moment the two men rose, spent
and breathless, from the stairs. The boy was behind
Barron, and they behind the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you? Where are you?&#8221; they heard him
cry, as he crashed forward through shrubs and flower
beds.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the policeman drew the small lantern
he had carried from beneath his cape and shot the
slide. A cube of clear, steady light cut through the
inky wall in front of them. For a second they all
stopped, the man sending the cylinder of radiance over
the shrubs and trees in swift sweeps. In one of these
it crossed a white face, quivered and rested on it.
Barron gave a wild cry and rushed forward.</p>

<p>She was, as the boy described, crouched under a
clump of small fir-trees, the lower limbs of which had
been removed. The place was sheltered from observation
from the house and the intrusion of the elements.
As the light fell on her she was kneeling, evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span>
having been drawn to that posture by Barron&#8217;s voice.
The light revealed her as hatless, with loosened hair,
her face pinched, her eyes large and wild.</p>

<p>As she saw Barron she shrieked and tried to move
forward, but was unable to and held out her arms. He
was at her side in a moment, his arms about her, straining
her to him, his lips, between frantic kisses, saying
words only for him and for her.</p>

<p>The policeman, with a soft ejaculation, turned the
lantern, and its cube of light fell into the heart of a bed
of petunias; then the two men and the boy stood looking
at it silently for a space.</p>

<p>Presently they heard Barron say: &#8220;Come, we must
go. I must take you home at once. Turn the light
this way, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light came back upon her. She was on her feet,
holding to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Sunday yet?&#8221; she said, looking at them with
an affrighted air.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what she keeps asking all the time,&#8221; said the
boy in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Barron, &#8220;it&#8217;s Friday. What do you expect
on Sunday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only Friday,&#8221; she said, hanging back. &#8220;I thought
I&#8217;d hide here till Sunday was over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without answering, he put his arm about her and
drew her forward. At the steps she hesitated again,
and he lifted her and carried her down, the policeman
preceding with the lantern. The men helped him into
the carriage, not saying much, while the boy stood with
his now liberated dog at the top of the steps and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[447]</span>
shouted, &#8220;Good night.&#8221; Barron hardly spoke to any
of them. A vague thought crossed his mind that he
would go to see the boy some day and thank him.</p>

<p>She lay with her head on his shoulder, and as the
carriage passed the first lamp of the route he leaned
forward eagerly to scan her face. It was haggard,
white and thin, as by a long illness. He could not
speak for a moment, could only hold her in his arms
as if thus to wind her round with the symbol of his
love.</p>

<p>Presently she groaned, and he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you suffering?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she murmured; &#8220;always now. I am sick. I
don&#8217;t breathe well any more. It hurts in my chest all
the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you hide under those trees?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was too sick to go any farther. I wanted to hide
somewhere, to get away from it all, and anyway, till
Sunday was over. It was all to be published on Sunday,
you know. Everything was ruined. My voice
was gone, too. I saw those steps in the dark and
climbed up and crept under the trees. I was terribly
tired, and it was very quiet up there. I don&#8217;t remember
much more.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the light of another lamp flashed through the
window he could not bear to look at her, but tightened
his arms about her and bowed his face on her wet head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh God, dearest,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;there can&#8217;t be
any hell worse than what I&#8217;ve been in for the last two
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no response, but lay passively against him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[448]</span>
When the carriage stopped at the Garcia gate, and he
told her they were home, she made no attempt to move,
and he saw she was unconscious.</p>

<p>He lifted her out and carried her up the steps. The
door opened as he ascended and revealed the Garcia
family in the aperture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she dead?&#8221; screamed young Mrs. Garcia, as she
saw the limp figure in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but sick. You must get a doctor at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how awful she looks!&#8221; cried the young woman
as she caught sight of the white face against his shoulder.
&#8220;What are you going to do with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take her upstairs now, and then get a doctor and
get her cured, and when she&#8217;s well, marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plant of the Silver Star Mine lay scattered along
the edge of a mountain river on the site of one of the
camps of forty-nine. Where the pioneers had scratched
the surface with their picks, their successors had torn
wounds in the Sierra&#8217;s mighty flank. Where once the
miners&#8217; shouts had broken the quiet harmonies of
stirred pine boughs, and singing river, the throb of engines
now beat on the air, thick with the dust, noisy
with the strife of toiling men.</p>

<p>It was a morning in the end of May. The mountain
wall was dark against the rising sun; tall fir and giant
pine stood along its crest in inky silhouette thrown out
by a background of gold leaf. Here and there, far and
a&euml;rial in the clear, cool dawn, a white peak of the high
Sierra floated above the shadows, a rosy pinnacle. The
air was chill and faintly touched with woodland odors.
The expectant hush of Nature awaiting the miracle of
sunrise, held this world of huge, primordial forms,
grouped in colossal indifference round the swarm of
men who delved in its rock-ribbed breast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[452]</span>In the stillness the camp&#8217;s awakening movements
rose upon the morning air with curious distinctness.
Through the blue shadows in which it swam the tall
chimneys soared aloft, sending their feathers of smoke
up to the new day. It lay in its hollow like a picture,
all transparent washes of amethyst and gray, overlaid
by clear mountain shadows. The world was in this
waiting stage of flushed sky and shaded earth when
the superintendent&#8217;s wife pushed open the door of her
house and with the cautious tread of one who fears to
wake a sleeper, stepped out on the balcony.</p>

<p>With her hand on the rail she stood, deeply inhaling
the freshness of the hour. The superintendent&#8217;s house,
a one-story cottage, painted white, and skirted by a
broad balcony, stood on an eminence above the camp.
From its front steps she looked down on the slant of
many roofs, the car tracks, and the red wagon roads
that wound along the slopes. Raising her eyes, they
swept the ramparts of the everlasting hills, and looking
higher still, her face met the radiance of the dawn.</p>

<p>She stepped off the balcony with the same cautious
tread, and along the beaten footpath that led through
the patch of garden in front of the house. Beyond
this the path wound through a growth of chaparral to
where the pines ascended the slopes in climbing files.
As she approached she saw the sky barred with their
trunks, arrow-straight and bare of branches to a great
height. Farther on she could see the long dim aisles,
held in the cloistral silence of the California forest,
shot through with the golden glimmer of sunrise.</p>

<p>The joy of the morning was in her heart, and she
walked forward with a light step, humming to herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span>
Two months before she had come here, a bride from
San Francisco, weak from illness, pale, hollow-eyed, a
shadow of her former self. She had only crept about
at first, swung for hours on the balcony in her hammock,
or sat under the trees looking down on the hive
of men, where her husband worked among his laborers.
As her mother had grown back to the fullness of
life in the healing breath of the mountains, so Mariposa
slowly regained her old beauty, with an added
touch of subtlety, and found her old beliefs returned to
her with a new significance.</p>

<p>To-day she had awakened with the first glimmer of
dawn, and stirred by a sudden desire for the air of the
morning on her face and in her lungs, had stolen up
and out. Breathing in the resinous atmosphere a new
influx of life seemed to run like sap along her limbs,
and lend her step the buoyancy of a wood-nymph&#8217;s.
Her eye lingered with a look that was a caress on
flower and tree and shrub. The song she had been
humming passed from tune to words, and she sang
softly as she brushed through the chaparral, snipping
off a leaf, bending to pluck a wild flower, pausing to
admire the glossy green of a manzanita bush. Under
the shadow of the pines she halted by a rugged trunk,
a point of vantage she had early discovered, and leaning
her hand on the bark, surveyed the wild prospect.</p>

<p>The sense of expectancy in the air seemed intensified.
The quivering radiance of pink and gold pulsed
up the sky from a point of concentration which every
moment brightened. The blue shadows in the camp
grew thinner, the little wisps of mist that hung over
the river more threadlike and phantasmal. A throwback<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[454]</span>
to unremembered days came suddenly upon her
with a mysterious sense of familiarity. She seemed to
be repeating a dear, long dead experience. The vision
and the dream of days of exquisite well-being, carefree,
cherished, were with her again. Faint recurring
glimpses of such mornings, strong of balsam of pine
and fir, musical with the sleepy murmur of a river,
serene and sweet with an enfolding passion of love in
which she rested secure, rose out of the dim places of
memory. The perfect content of her childhood spoke
to her across the gulf of years, finding itself repeated
in her womanhood. The old joy in living, the old thrill
of wonder and mystery, the old sense of safety in a
surrounding, watchful love, were hers once more.</p>

<p>The song on her lips passed from its absent undertone
to notes gradually full and fuller. It was the aria
from &#8220;Mignon,&#8221; and, as she stood, her hand on the tree
trunk, looking down into the swimming shadows of the
camp, it swelled outward in tones strong and rich, vibrating
with their lost force.</p>

<p>Pervaded by a sense of dreamy happiness, she at first
failed to notice the unexpected volume of sound.
Then, as note rose upon note, welling from her chest
with the old-time, vibrant facility, as she felt once
again the uplifting sense of triumph possess her, she
realized what it meant. Dropping her hand from the
tree trunk she stood upright, and facing the dawn,
with squared shoulders and raised chin, let her voice
roll out into the void before her.</p>

<p>The song swelled triumphant like a hymn of some
pagan goddess to the rising sun. In the stillness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[455]</span>
the dawn-hush, with the columns of the monumental
pines behind her, the mountain wall and the glowing
sky in front, she might have been the spirit of youth
and love chanting her joy in a primeval world.</p>

<p>When the last note had died away she stood for a
moment staring before her. Then suddenly she
wheeled, and, catching up her skirts with one hand,
ran back toward the house, brushing between the tree-trunks
and through the chaparral with breathless
haste. As she emerged from the thicket, she saw her
husband, in his rough mining clothes, standing on the
top step of the balcony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gam,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Gam!&#8221;</p>

<p>He started, saw her, and then waited smiling as she
came running up the garden path toward him, the
blaze of the sky behind her, her face alight with life
and color.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, dearest, I didn&#8217;t know what had happened to
you,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Where did you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her unslackened speed carried her up the stairs and
into his arms. Standing on the step below him she
flung hers round his shoulders, and holding him tight,
said breathlessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You met a bear in the wood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My voice has come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two pairs of eyes, the woman&#8217;s looking up, the
man&#8217;s down, gazed deeply into each other. There was
a moment of silence, the silence of people who are still
unused to and a little overawed by their happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[456]</span>&#8220;You did? From here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I heard some one singing and stood here listening,
watching the light coming up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it good?&#8221; she asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very. I had never heard you sing before. You&#8217;re
a prima donna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I was going to be. You remember
hearing us talking about it at the Garcias&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, looking down at the face where health
was coming back in delicate degrees of coral to lips
and cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it really did sound good?&#8221; she queried again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite soft and full, not harsh and with all the sound
of music gone out of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit. It was fine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She continued to hold him around the shoulders, but
her eyes dropped away from his, which regarded her
with immovable earnestness, touched by a slight, tender
humor. She appeared to become suddenly thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can be a prima donna still,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, nodding slightly. &#8220;I suppose
I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a great career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a splendid career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You travel everywhere and make a fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;d be a success all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew away from him, letting one hand rest on
his shoulder. Her face had grown serious. She looked
disappointed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[457]</span>&#8220;Well, do you <i>want</i> me to be a prima donna?&#8221; she
asked, looking at her hand.</p>

<p>He continued to regard her without answering, the
gleam of amusement dying out of his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she added in a small voice, &#8220;if you&#8217;ve
set your heart on it, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think about it yourself?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She gave him a swift, side look, just a raising and
dropping of the lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say what you think first,&#8221; she coaxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his two hands suddenly on her shoulders,
big, bronzed hands, hard and muscular, that seemed
to seize upon her delicate flesh with a master&#8217;s grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me,&#8221; he commanded.</p>

<p>She obeyed. The gray eyes held hers like a magnet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think no. You don&#8217;t belong to the public, you
belong to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color ran up into her face to the edge of her
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Gam,&#8221; she whispered on a rising breath, &#8220;I&#8217;m
so relieved.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped his hands from her shoulders and drew
her close to him. With his cheek against hers he
said softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t think I was that kind of a fool, did
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sun had risen as they talked, at first slowly
peering with a radiant eye over the mountain&#8217;s shoulder,
then shaking itself free of tree-top and rock-point,
and swimming up into the blue. The top of the
range stood all glowing and golden, with here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[458]</span>
there a white peak, snowily enameled. The rows of
pines were overlaid with a rosy brilliance, their long
shadows slanting down the slopes as if scurrying away
from the flood of heat and light. The clear blues and
amethysts that veiled the hollow of the camp were dispersed;
the films of mist melted; a quivering silvery
sparkle played over the river shallows.</p>

<p>In the clearing beams the life of the hive below
seemed to swarm and fill the air with the clamor of its
awakening. The man and woman, looking down, saw
the toiling world turning to its day&#8217;s work&mdash;the red
dust rising beneath grinding hoof and wheel, the cars
sliding swiftly on their narrow tracks, heard the shouts
of men, the hum of machinery, and through all and
over all, the regular throb of the engines like the heart
which animated this isolated world of labor.</p>

<p>Barron looked at his domain for an attentive moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, pointing down, &#8220;is where I belong.
That&#8217;s my life,&mdash;to work in wild places with men. And
yours is with me, my prima donna. We go together,
side by side, I working and you singing by the way.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This is something more than a mere detective story; it is
a thrilling romance&mdash;a romance of mystery and crime where
a shrewd detective helps to solve the mystery. The plot is a
novel and intricate one, carefully worked out. There are constant
accessions to the main mystery, so that the reader can
not possibly imagine the conclusion. The story is clean-cut
and wholesome, with a quality that might be called manly.
The characters are depicted so as to make a living impression.
Cora Tuttle is a fine creation, and the flash of love which she
gives the hero is wonderfully well done. Unlike many mystery
stories The Filigree Ball is not disappointing at the end. The
characters most liked but longest suspected are proved not only
guiltless, but above suspicion. It is a story to be read with a
rush and at a sitting, for no one can put it down until the
mystery is solved.</p>

<p>In &#8220;The Mississippi Bubble&#8221; Emerson Hough has taken

<p>As a novel embodying a wonderful period in the growth of
America &#8220;The Mississippi Bubble&#8221; is of intense interest. As
a love story it is rarely and beautifully told. John Law, as

he is an Admirable Crichton in his personality, and a
Napoleon in his far-reaching wisdom.&mdash;<i>The Chicago American.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
